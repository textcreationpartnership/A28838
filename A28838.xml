            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>TO THE Dauphin. The General Deſign of this Work.</head>
               <p>THough Hiſtory were little ſignificant to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men, yet it ought to be read by Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. There is no better way to diſcover to them the various effects and conſequences of Paſſions and Intereſts, Times and Conjunctures, good and evil Councils. Hiſtories are only compoſed and made up of ſuch actions as they are engaged in, and in them every thing ſeems to be done for their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe. If experience be neceſſary for them to obtain that prudence which may enable them to Reign well, there can be nothing of greater advantage to their inſtruction, than to join to the examples of former Ages, their own daily experiences: Whereas other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they moſt an end learn only to judge of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous affairs that occur to them, at the expence of both their own Subjects and Glory. But by this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of Hiſtory, without hazarding any thing, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their judgments by paſt Events. When they ſee even into the moſt ſecret Vices of Princes, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the deceitful Flatteries given them in their Lives, expoſed to the Eyes of all Men, they bluſh at the vain Joys and Pleaſures, which ſuch adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb facs="tcp:56382:4"/> raiſes in them, and ſenſibly find that there can be no true honour, but where there is a juſt merit.</p>
               <p>Beſides it would be a ſhame, I do not ſay to a Prince alone, but in general to any Man of ſence and worth, to be ignorant of <hi>humane kind,</hi> and of the memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Changes that have happened in the World, through all the Succeſſion of Time. If we do not learn from Hiſtory how to diſtinguiſh Times, we ſhall repreſent Men under the Law of Nature, or under the Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Law, to be ſuch as are under the Evangelick Law; we ſhall ſpeak of <hi>Perſians</hi> conquered by <hi>Alexander,</hi> as of thoſe victorius <hi>Perſians</hi> under <hi>Cyrus;</hi> we ſhall make <hi>Greece</hi> as free in the time of <hi>Philip,</hi> as in that of <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> or <hi>Miltiades;</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> People as fierce under the Emperors as under the Conſuls; the Church in as great Tranquillity under <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> as under <hi>Conſtantine;</hi> and <hi>France</hi> labouring under the Convulſions of their Civil Wars in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, as puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant as in the time of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth, which, being reunited under ſo great a Monarch, by it ſelf triumphs over almoſt all <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, Sir, it was to avoid theſe inconveniences, that you have read ſo many Hiſtories both Antient and Modern. It was requiſite in the firſt place to make you acquainted with the Sacred Pages, and therein to read the Hiſtory of the People of God, which ſerves as a good Foundation to Religion. Nor have you been ſuffered to be ignorant in the <hi>Greek,</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory; and which was moſt important to you, you
<pb facs="tcp:56382:4"/> have been carefully inſtructed in the Hiſtory of this great Kingdom, which you are obliged to render happy. But leſt theſe Hiſtories, and thoſe you are yet to learn, ſhould work any confuſion in your mind, there is nothing more neceſſary, than diſtinctly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to you, but as contractedly as we can, all the whole Series of Ages.</p>
               <p>This way of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niuerſal Hiſtory is, in regard to the Hiſtories of every Country and People, what a general Mapp is to the particular ones. In the latter you ſee only the whole deſcription one Kingdom, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince by it ſelf; but in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niuerſal Mapp you learn how to ſituate thoſe parts of the World in the whole: You ſee what <hi>Paris,</hi> or the Iſle of <hi>France</hi> is in the Kingdom, what the Kingdom is in <hi>Europe,</hi> and what <hi>Europe</hi> is in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe particular Hiſtories repreſent to you what things have happened to ſuch or ſuch a People, with all their Circumstances: but to underſtand the whole clearly, you muſt know what relation every Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory can have to others, which is done by ſuch a way as this is, in ſhort, where at one glance of your Eye, as it were, you may ſee all the order of time.</p>
               <p>Such an Abridgment, Sir, gives you a very great ſight. You ſee all precedent Ages laid, as I may ſay, before you in a few hours: You ſee how Empires have ſucceeded one the other, and how Religion in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Eſtates hath equally balanced and ſupported it ſelf, even from the beginning of the World to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time.</p>
               <p>'Tis the effect of theſe two things, I mean, that of
<pb facs="tcp:56382:5"/> Religion, and that of Empires, which ought to be deeply imprinted in your memory; and as Religion and Political Government are the two hinges on which all humane Affairs do turn, to ſee what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns theſe things in a ſmall abridged Volume, and to diſcover by this means the exact order and event thereof, is to comprehend in his thoughts whatſoever is great and glorious among Men, and to hold, as I may ſay, the thread of all the Affairs of the World.</p>
               <p>And as, when you look upon an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Map, you may preſently go off from your own native Country, and from the place which bounds you, and run thro' all the habitable Earth with all its Seas and Countries, which may give a great entertainment to your thoughts: ſo by looking upon ſuch a Chronological Abridgment, you may go away from the narrow confinements of your own time, and extend your ſelf into all Ages.</p>
               <p>But as, to help ones memory in the knowledge of places, we muſt keep in our minds certain chief Towns and Cities, round which we are to place all the reſt, according to their ſeveral diſtances; ſo in the order of Ages we muſt remember certain Times Memorable for ſome great event and action, to which we are to bring all the other.</p>
               <p>This we call an <hi>Epocha,</hi> from a <hi>Greek</hi> word that ſignifies to pauſe upon, becauſe we ſtay our ſelves there to conſider, as at a place of reſt, whatſoever hath happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both before and ſince, and by that means do avoid the Anachroniſms, that is to ſay, that ſort of Error which makes the confuſion of time.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56382:5"/>
               <p>We muſt first fix but upon a ſmall number of <hi>Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha's,</hi> ſuch as, in the times of antient History, are <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> or the Creation; <hi>Noah,</hi> or the Deluge; the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or the beginning of God's Alliance with Man; <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the written Laws; the taking of <hi>Troy; Solomon,</hi> or the building of the Temple; <hi>Romulus,</hi> or the founding of <hi>Rome; Cyrus,</hi> or the People of God delivered from the Captivity <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon; Scipio,</hi> or <hi>Carthage</hi> overcome; the nativity of our bleſſed Saviour; <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> or the peace of the Church; <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> or the Eſtabliſhment of the new Empire.</p>
               <p>I make this Eſtabliſhment of the new Empire under <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> as the end of the antient History, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is there that you will find the antient <hi>Roman</hi> Empire wholly to conclude and end. And therefore I ſtay and fix you at ſo conſiderable a point of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal History. The continuance ſhall be preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to you in a Second Part, which I deſign ſhall bring you to the Age, which the Immortal actions of your Father make illuſtrious, and to which, the ardour you ſhow of following ſo great an Example, makes us, yet to hope a new luſtre may be added.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Deſign of this firſt Diſcourſe is divided into Three Parts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this general Explication of the deſign of this Work, I find there are three things neceſſary for me to do, to draw all the profit I hope for from it.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56382:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>First of all, I muſt attend you thro' all the <hi>Epocha's</hi> which I have laid down, and if you pleaſe to obſerve with me in this Brevity the principal Events which I ſhall fix to every one of them, I ſhall habituate your mind to put theſe Events in their place, without any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard than to the order of Time. But as my main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is to make you obſerve in this efflux of time, that of Religion, and that of great Empires: After I have ſhewed you, according to the courſe of years, how theſe things have gone on together, I ſhall particularly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take my ſelf with ſome neceſſary reflections, to conſider firſt of thoſe which give us to underſtand the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual duration of Religion, and then come to the other which diſcover to us the cauſes of the great Changes and Revolutions which have happened in Empires.</p>
               <p>After this is done, you will find that what part of antient History ſoever you read, all will turn to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and advantage. There will not any action or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paſs you, but you will perceive the effects of it. You will admire the Conſequences of the Councils of God in the Affairs of Religion: You will alſo ſee the chain of humane Affairs, and by that will know with how much of reflection and prudent foreſight they ought to be governed.</p>

               <p>Every thing begins: There is no antient Hiſtory wherein there appears, not only in theſe firſt times, but a long time after, ſome manifeſt <hi>Veſtigia</hi> of the newneſs of the World. We ſee Laws were to be made and eſtabliſhed, Manners to be amended, and Empires to be formed. Mankind coming out by degrees from Ignorance; Experience inſtructs them, and Arts are either invented or perfected. Accordingly as Men multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Land was populated, and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants came to live nearer to one another. Mountains and Precipices were paſſed over; Rivers croſt, and at laſt the Seas; and Men eſtabliſhed new Habitations. The Earth, which in the Beginning was but a wild Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, now took another Form; the grub'd-up
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56382:9"/> Trees gave way to Fields, Paſturages, Hamlets, Burroughs, and at length to Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. They began then to have the Art and Cunning of taking ſome kind of Beaſts, of tarning others, and bringing them up to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Service. At firſt they were uſed to ingage and fight with wild Beaſts. The firſt <hi>Heroes</hi> made themſelves ſignal in theſe ſort of Exerciſes.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> x. 9.</note> This gave occaſion to the inventing of Arms, which afterwards Men turned one againſt another: <hi>Nimrod,</hi> the firſt Warrior and firſt Conqueror, is called in Scripture a mighty Hunter. But Man's Skill lay not only in Beaſts, he knew alſo how to bring up Plants, and ripen Fruits. He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe reduced Metals to his uſe, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees made them ſerviceable to all Mankind. And as it was but natural, that time ſhould invent and find out a great many things, ſo likewiſe time made ſeveral other things be forgot, at leaſt to moſt Men. Thoſe firſt Arts which <hi>Noah</hi> had preſerved, and which are always kept up in ſome Countries, where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For either they muſt be learned over again with time, or elſe thoſe who had preſerved them, muſt carry them over to thoſe others. Wherefore we ſee all things, to come from Lands that have been always inhabited, where the Grounds and Foundations of Arts remain in their Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and there alſo is to be learned every day things very conſiderable. The Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and the Remembrance of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56382:9"/> the Creation was preſerved there; but it did daily degenerate, and grew weaker and weaker. The Ancient Traditions were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quite forgot, or at leaſt obſcure and dim: The Fables and Stories that have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded them, retain'd only the groſs Ideas of them: Falſe Deities multiplied and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more numerous, and that gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the calling of <hi>Abraham.</hi>

               <p>As to the Monarchy of the <hi>Medes,</hi> which has the ſecond Preference among the great
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56382:25"/> Empires by moſt of the prophane Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as ſeparated from the Empire of <hi>Perſia,</hi> certain it is, that the Scripture ever unites them both together. And your Highneſs ſees, that beſides the Authority of the ſacred pages, the bare order of Matters of Fact, ſhews us, that it is that we are ſtill to look at.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Medes</hi> before <hi>Cyrus,</hi> though they were very powerful and conſiderable, yet were much leſſened by the greatneſs of the Kings of <hi>Babylon.</hi> But <hi>Cyrus</hi> having Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered their Kingdom by the collected For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces both of <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> of which he afterwards became the Maſter, by a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate Succeſſion, as we have obſerved from <hi>Zenophon;</hi> it ſeems moſt probable, that the great Empire, of which he was the Founder, as it ought indeed, did take his Name to both Nations, ſo that That of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> are but one and the ſame thing, tho' the glory of <hi>Cyrus</hi> made the name of the <hi>Perſians</hi> to be the more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing.</p>
               <p>It may be alſo thought, that before the VVar of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Kings of the <hi>Medes</hi> having extended their Conqueſts to the <hi>Greek</hi> Colonies in leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> were by that means famous among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed the Empire of greater <hi>Aſia</hi> to them, becauſe they were only acquainted with them of all the Kings of the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> And yet the Kings of <hi>Nineveh</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> who were greater and more puiſſant, but more unknown to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> have been near quite forgotten in thoſe B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And therefore we need not to trouble our heads ſo much in reconciling as to this point the prophane to the ſacred Hiſtory. For as to what reſpects the firſt Kingdom of the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> the Scripture gives us but a very ſlight touch by the Bye, and neither mentions <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> who was the Founder of that Empire, nor, excepting <hi>Phul,</hi> any other of its Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors: becauſe their Hiſtory was no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfering with that of the People of God. As for the ſecond Kingdom of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> moſt of the <hi>Greeks</hi> are either quite ignorant of them, or elſe becauſe they have not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known them as they ought, they have confounded them with the former.</p>

               <p>And that which in one word anſwers all the difficulty; the ſacred Authors, who are nearer to the times and places of the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Kingdoms, writing moreover the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a People, whoſe affairs were ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed with thoſe of theſe great Empires,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56382:26"/> though they had no other advantage beſides this, it were enough to put the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> to Silence, who followed them.</p>
               <p>But if, notwithſtanding, the obſtinacy ſhould go on ſtill to maintain this celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted order of the three firſt Monarchies, and that to keep entirely to the <hi>Medes</hi> the ſecond rank which is aſcribed to them, any are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reſolved to make the Kings of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſubject to them, in affirming ſtill that after an hundred Years Subjection, theſe at laſt ſhould deliver themſelves by a Revolt; yet in ſome manner it doth ſave the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>There is yet remaining to be diſcovered one of the Cauſes of the obſcurity and darkneſs of theſe antient Hiſtories. And it is this, that as the Eaſtern Kings took up ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral names, or if you pleaſe, ſeveral ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, which in ſome length of time they eſpouſed as their own Name, and which the People either tranſlated, or pronounced variouſly, according to the ſeveral particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Idioms of each reſpective Language; Thoſe ſo antient Hiſtories, whereof there is left now but a very few good Memorials, are by this means become in all Probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo very dark and imperfect. The confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of names hath no doubt contributed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much both to the things as well as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of them; and from hence proceeds our
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56382:27"/> Trouble, rightly to ſituate in the <hi>Greek</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory thoſe Kings, who have had the Name of <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> as much unheard of to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as it was well known to the Eaſtern Countries.</p>
               <p>VVho would indeed believe that <hi>Cyago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> was the ſame name as <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> made up of the word <hi>Ky,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Sir,</hi> or <hi>Lord,</hi> and from the word <hi>Axare,</hi> which manifeſtly returns to <hi>Axuerus,</hi> or <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> and ſo <hi>Ahaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erus? Three</hi> or <hi>Four</hi> Princes have gone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Name, though they had others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. If we do not know that <hi>Nebuchodono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor, Nebucodroſor,</hi> and <hi>Nebocolaſſar</hi> were only one and the ſame Name, or the Name of but one Perſon, it would be difficult for us to believe it; and yet the thing is moſt certain. <hi>Sargon</hi> is <hi>Sennacherib; Ozias</hi> is <hi>Azarias; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dechias</hi> is <hi>Mathanias, Joachas</hi> is alſo called <hi>Sellum.

It is not unknown to the <hi>Latins,</hi> among whom Titles and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doptions have multiplyed Names in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kinds. Thus the Title of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and that of <hi>Africanus</hi> became the Sir-Names of <hi>Caeſar Octavianus</hi> and the <hi>Scipio</hi>'s; and in like manner the <hi>Neros</hi> have been <hi>Caeſars.</hi> The

               <p>I will not now offer to trouble your <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> any further with the knotty difficulties of Chronology, which are as little neceſſary as uſeful for you.

                  <hi>Cornelius Nepos,</hi> an Ancient and Judicious, as well as an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Author, will not have us queſtion this Date, after the Authority of <hi>Thucydides:</hi> and it is ſo much a ſtronger Argument, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe another more Antient Author than <hi>Thucydides</hi> was, agrees with him.

Therefore, beyond all diſpute, we ought to reckon the beginning of it toward the end of the ſeventy ſix <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiad,</hi> and near the 280 year of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo the twentieth year of this Prince will come to be about the end of the eighty firſt

But whilſt the Laws were framing under theſe ten Magiſtrates, <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras,</hi> a Doctor of the Law, and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> the Governour of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> People newly re-eſtabliſhed in <hi>Judah,</hi> were reforming the Abuſes, and bringing in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo that they began to be obſerved in the firſt place. One of the main points of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was to oblige all the People,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Eſdr.</hi> xiii. <hi>Deut.</hi> xxiii. 3.</note> and particularly the Prieſts, to leave their ſtrange Wives, whom they had married contrary to the expreſs Letter of the Law. <hi>Eſdras</hi> put the Holy Books in order, and made a very exact review of them, and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the Antient Memoires of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to compile out of them the two Books of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralipomena,</hi> or <hi>Chronicles,</hi> to which he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Hiſtory of his own Time, which <hi>Nehemiah</hi> finiſhed. By thoſe Books is that long and tedious Hiſtory, which <hi>Moſes</hi> had
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56382:32"/> begun, ended; and which the following Authors continued without interruption till the re-building of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The reſt of the Sacred Hiſtory is not writ in the ſame train. Whilſt <hi>Eſdras</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> were making the laſt part of this great Work, <hi>Herodotus,</hi> whom the Prophane Authors call the Father of Hiſtory it ſelf, began to write. So that the laſt Authors of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Hiſtory met with the firſt Author of the <hi>Greek</hi> Hiſtory; and when this began, That of the <hi>Jews,</hi> only to take it from <hi>Abraham,</hi> already had made up five Ages. <hi>Herodotus</hi> never thought to ſpeak of the <hi>Jews</hi> in that Hiſtory he hath left us; and the <hi>Greeks</hi> would not inform themſelves of any, but ſuch People whom War, Commerce, or a great Fame had made notorious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable. <hi>Judah,</hi> that with great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty began to raiſe it ſelf from the Aſhes of its Ruine, never in the leaſt attracted their regards. And it was in this miſerable and calamitous time that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language ceaſed to be common. During the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and afterwards by the commerce that happened between them and the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> learned the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Tongue, which very much bordered upon their own, and had almoſt the ſame Idiom and Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us. This reaſon induced them to change the ancient Figure of <hi>Hebrew</hi> Letters, and ſo they writ <hi>Hebrew</hi> in the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Characters which were moſt in uſe among them, and eaſier to be made. This alteration was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inſenſible between the two Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Languages, whoſe Letters were of the ſame
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56382:33"/> value and efficacy, only differing ſomewhat in their formation. From that time the Holy Scripture was only to be found among the <hi>Jews</hi> in the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Letters; But the <hi>Samaritans</hi> ſtill kept their old way of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Their Poſterity have perſevered in the ſame Cuſtom, even down to our days, and by that means have preſerved the <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch,</hi> which they call the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> in ancient <hi>Hebrew</hi> Characters, ſuch as they found them in Medals, and in all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of paſt Ages.</p>
               <p>The Jews lived very peaceably and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the Authority of <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi> That Prince being forced by <hi>Cymon</hi> the Son of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiades,</hi> General of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> to make a ſhameful peace, utterly deſpaired of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the <hi>Greeks</hi> by force, and ſo only thought of making his advantage by their feuds and diviſions.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56382:52"/> There began with the ſeventy weeks of <hi>Daniel,</hi> the Preaching of Jeſus Chriſt. This laſt Week was the moſt important, and the moſt obſervable. <hi>Daniel</hi> had divided it from the reſt, as the Week or Alliance was to be confirmed,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Daniel</hi> iv. 37.</note> and in the midſt of which the ancient Sacrifices were to loſe their effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy and virtue. It may be called the week of Myſteries. Jeſus Chriſt eſtabliſhed his Miſſion and his Doctrine then by innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Miracles, and at laſt by his Death. It <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Years of J. C. </seg>33</label> happened in the fourth year of his Miniſtry, which was alſo the fourth Year of <hi>Daniel's</hi> laſt Week, and this great Week was in this manner juſtly cut in the midſt by his Death.</p>
               <p>Thus it is eaſy to make up the Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the VVeeks, or rather it is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy made up. There remains nothing now but to add to the 453 Years, which we ſhall find from the 300th. year of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the twentieth of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> down to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the common <hi>Aera,</hi> the thirty Years of that <hi>Aera,</hi> which we ſee comes down to the fifteenth year of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and to the Baptiſm of our Lord: Theſe two Summs will make up 483 years; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Years ſtill remain to compleat the 490. The fourth, which makes the middle, is that in which Jeſus Chriſt died: and all that <hi>Daniel</hi> hath propheſied, is viſibly ſhut up within the preſcribed term. There is no extraordinary neceſſity for ſuch an exact punctilio of Juſtneſs, and nothing obliges us to take in this extream rigour the Middle obſerved by <hi>Daniel.</hi> The moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult

The Emperor was ſo concern'd at it, that he writ to the Senate in Favour of the Chriſtians. At laſt the Southſayers Perſuaſions were to attribute to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56382:57"/> their Gods, and to their Prayers, a Miracle which the Heathens never thought ſo much as to deſire.

The Fury and Rage of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens was re-kindled, and the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire did as it were ſwim in the Blood of Martyrs. Still their Doctrine went on and attended their Sufferings. In <hi>Severus</hi> his time, and ſome while after, <hi>Tertullian</hi> Prieſt of <hi>Carthage,</hi> illuminated the Church by his Writings, defended it by a moſt admirable Apologiſm, and left it at laſt, being blinded by an haughty Severity, and ſeduced by the Viſions of the falſe Prophet <hi>Montanus.</hi> Some time, but not long after, <hi>Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus</hi> indeavoured to pull up the Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Heatheniſm by the Roots, that ſo he might utterly put an end to them. <hi>Origen,</hi> the Son of the Holy Martyr <hi>Leonidas,</hi> made himſelf famous throughout all the Church, even from his moſt tender Years, and taught great Truths, though they were mixt with ſeveral Errors. The Philoſopher <hi>Ammoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> joined the <hi>Platonick</hi> Philoſophy to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and gained to himſelf the Reſpect of the Heathens.

Thus have we ſeen the ſeven general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, which the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and the <hi>West,</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> and the <hi>Latin Churches</hi> received with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Reverence. The Emperors convoked thoſe great Aſſemblies by the Soveraign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority they had over all the Biſhops, or at leaſt over the Chief, on whom the reſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, and who were then Subject of the Empire. The publick Carriages were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by the Order of the Princes. They

The Biſhops ſo aſſembled, brought with them the Authority of the Holy Ghoſt, and the Tradition of the Churches. From the beginning of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity there were three principal Sees, which had the precedency of all others; that of <hi>Rome,</hi> that of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and that of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch.</hi>

                  </note> The <hi>Nicene</hi> Council allowed the Biſhop of the Holy City to have the firſt place. The ſecond, and the fourth Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil raiſed the See of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and would have that the ſecond. So that there were five Sees, which afterwards were called Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal. The Precedency was given to them in the Council. Among thoſe Sees, the See of <hi>Rome</hi> was always look'd on as the firſt, and the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> regulated the others upon that.<note place="margin">Conc. Nic. Can. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> There were alſo Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan Biſhops, who were the Chiefs of the Provinces, and who went before the other Biſhops. It was very late ere they began to be called Archbiſhops; but their Authority was never the leſs. When the Council was formed, the Holy Scriptures were propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; the Paſſages of the antient Fathers, Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of Tradition, were read: It was Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which interpreted Scripture: They believed its true Sence was that which the paſt Ages had owned it to be, and none thought they ought to explain it otherwiſe. Thoſe who refuſed to ſubmit to the Deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Council, were curſed with the Anathema. After they had explained the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56382:81"/> Faith, they regulated the Eccleſiaſtical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and made Canons, that is to ſay, the Rules of the Church. They thought the Faith did never change, and tho' the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline might receive ſeveral Changes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to difference of Times and Places, yet as much as poſſibly we can we ought to labour after a perfect imitation of Antiquity. But the Popes were only there by their Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates in the firſt general Councils; but they did however expreſly approve of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and there was but one Faith in the Church.</p>

               <p>YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R Highneſs ſees the twelve <hi>Epocha's</hi> which I have followed in this Abridgment: I have chained to each of them the principal matters that are dependent thereon. You may now without any great difficulty diſpoſe of, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order of Time, the great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of the Antient Hiſtory, and range them (as I may ſo ſpeak) each under its proper Standard.</p>
               <p>I have not in this Abſtract forgot that celebrated distinction which the Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſts make of the continuance of the World in <hi>7.</hi> Ages. The beginning of every one of them ſerves us for an <hi>Epocha:</hi> If I have mixt any others with them, it is that ſo things may be more diſtinct, and that the order of time may be opened to You with leſs confuſion.</p>
               <p>When I ſpeak to You of the order of Time, I do not pretend, My Lord, that You ſhould ſcrupulouſly charge Your memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with all the dates; much leſs that You
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56382:83"/> ſhould concern Your ſelf with all the nice diſputes of the Chronologiſts, where moſt an end they differ but in a very few years. There is no question but that this conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Chronology which ſcrupulouſly is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up about thoſe ſmall matters hath its uſe; but that is not Your object, and is of very little ſervice to enlighten the mind of a great Prince. I would not be too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined upon this diſcuſſion of Time, but in the calculations I have already made, I have ſtill followed that which has appeared to me the moſt probable, without troubling my ſelf to be Guarranty for it.</p>
               <p>In the ſupputation of years which is made ſince the time of the Creation down to <hi>Abraham,</hi> we had best join with the LXX. which makes the World older, whereas the Hebrew makes it younger by many Ages: Although the Authority of the Original Hebrew ſeems as if it ought to carry it, yet it is a thing ſo indifferent in it ſelf, that the Church, which hath with St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> followed the ſupputation of the Hebrew in our Vulgar Tranſlation, hath left that of the LXX. in its Martyrology. In effect, what matter is it for Hiſtory either to diminiſh, or to multiply void Age, where alſo there is nothing to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of? Is it not enough that the times, where the dates are important, have their
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56382:83" rendition="simple:additions"/> fixed Characters, and the diſtribution of them be ſupported on certain foundations? And tho' even in thoſe times there ſhould be a diſpute about ſome years, it ſhould ſcarce ever make us perplexed and uneaſie. As for inſtance, if we ſhould put it ſome years ſooner or later when <hi>Rome</hi> was founded, or our bleſſed Saviour born, You must own that ſuch a diverſity makes nothing to the courſe of Histories, nor to the accompliſhing of the Councils of God. You muſt be careful to ſhun the <hi>Anachro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſms</hi> which ruffle and embroyl the order of Affairs, and leave the others to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes of the Learned.</p>
               <p>I will not further oppreſs Your memory with the account of the <hi>Olympiads,</hi> tho' the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who make uſe of that, render them very neceſſary for the fixing of Times. It is fit You ſhould know it, that You may, when there is occaſion, have recourſe to it: But it will be ſufficient to keep to the dates which I propoſe to You, as being the mos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But the true deſign of this Abridgment is not to explain to You the order of Time, tho' it be abſolutely neceſſary in the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56382:84"/> of all Histories, and in ſhewing how they relate to one another. I have told You, My Lord, That my principal Object is to make you conſider in the order of time, the courſe of the people of God, and that of great Empires.</p>
               <p>Theſe two things roul together in this great Movement of Ages, where they have, as I may ſay, one and the ſame courſe. But it is needful, to understand them truly, to detach them ſometimes one from the other, and to conſider whatſoever hath relation to each of them.</p>

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56382:85"/> Celeſtial good things, which will yield them Eternal pleaſure and ſatisfaction, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, through the hopes at laſt of coming to enjoy them, all the evils and miſeries of this World which can exerciſe their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>
               <p>Certainly, my Lord, nothing can come into the heart of man to conceive more worthy of God, than that he ſhould firſt of all chooſe to himſelf a people, which ſhould be a moſt manifeſt Example of his Eternal Providence; a people whoſe good or evil depends on Piety, and whoſe condition bears evidence to the Wiſdom and Juſtice of him who governs them. Here it was where God began, and this he fully diſcovered in the people of the Jews. But after he had by ſo many ſenſible manifeſtations eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this immutable foundation, whereby he alone after the pleaſure of his own Will did manage all the events of the preſent life, it was time to exalt men to higher thoughts, and to ſend <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to whom it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to diſcover to a new people collected out of all the people of the World, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets and Myſteries of a life to come.</p>
               <p>You may eaſily follow the Hiſtory of theſe two ſorts of people, and obſerve, as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> doth, the Union of them both, ſince that whether looked for or given, it was ever the Conſolation and the Hope of the Sons of God.</p>
               <p>Thus then Religion was always uniform, or rather always the ſame from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the World; they always acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the ſame One God, as the Author,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:56382:85" rendition="simple:additions"/> and the ſame Jeſus Chriſt, as the Saviour of Mankind.</p>
               <p>Thus You will ſee there was nothing more antient among men than the Religion which You profeſs, and it is not without reaſon that your Anceſtors have accounted it their greateſt glory to be the Protectors of it.</p>
               <p>What Teſtimony is this of its truth, to ſee that in the times wherein the prophane Hiſtories have nothing in them but what is fabulous, or, at moſt, things that are confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and half forgotten, the Holy Scripture, that is to ſay, (without controverſie) the moſt antient Book in the World, brings us back by ſo many curious but preciſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and by the ſame thread of things, to their true principle, that is to ſay, to God, the Maker of all things; and does point out to us ſo diſtinctly the Creation of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, that of man in particular, the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his firſt Eſtate, the cauſes of his miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and frailties; the Corruption of the World, and the Deluge; the beginning of Arts, and thoſe of Nations; the diſtribution of Countries: in a word, the propagation of Mankind, and other matters of the ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, whereof humane Hiſtories ſpeak but confuſedly, and oblige us elſewhere to ſeek for the certain ſources of them.</p>
               <p>And if the Antiquity of Religion gives it ſo much Authority, its continued courſe without interruption, and without alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ſo many ſucceſſive Ages, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all its manifold ſurprizing obſtacles, does manifeſtly diſcover to us, that it is the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56382:86" rendition="simple:additions"/> hand of God alone that ſuſtains it.</p>
               <p>What is there more marvellous than to behold it always ſubſiſting upon the ſame foundations of the beginnings of the World, and neither the Idolatry and Impiety which ſurround it on every ſide, nor the Tyrants that have perſecuted it, nor the Heretics and Infidels who have endeavoured to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt it, nor the Cowardly that have betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, nor the unworthy Schiſmatics who have diſhonoured it by their Crimes; nor, to conclude, the length of time, which alone was ſufficient to wear away all humane things; neither of theſe, I ſay, have been capable, not only not to extinguiſh, but ſo much as to alter it.</p>
               <p>If we now ſhall conſider what Idea this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, for whoſe Antiquity we have ſo great a Reverence, gives us of its object, that is to ſay, of the firſt Being, we ſhall confeſs that it is ſuperiour to all humane apprehenſions, and deſerving to be regarded as coming from God himſelf.</p>
               <p>That God whom the <hi>Hebrews</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have always ſerved and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, hath nothing in common with thoſe Divinities full of Imperfection, and even of Vice, which the reſt of the World adored. Our God is One, Infinite, Perfect, only worthy to revenge Wickedneſs and Vice, and to Crown Vertue, becauſe that He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is Holineſs it ſelf.</p>
               <p>He is infinitely above that firſt Cauſe, and of that firſt Mover, which the Philoſophers of old have acknowledged, but yet have not adored. Thoſe of them that have been
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56382:86"/> the moſt remote, have propoſed to us one God, who finding a matter Eternal, and exiſting by it ſelf as well as He, hath put it into frame, and faſhioned it as a common Artificer, conſtrained in his work by that matter, and by thoſe diſpoſitions which he did not make, without ever being able to comprehend, that if the matter were of it ſelf, it could not ſtay to have its perfection from a ſtrange hand, and that if God be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and perfect, he hath not to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he pleaſeth, but only of himſelf, and of his omnipotent Will. But the God of our Fathers, the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the God of whom <hi>Moſes</hi> hath delivered wonders to us, hath not only ranged this World, but he hath done it all entire in its matter, and in its form. Before he had given it a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nothing had it but himſelf. He is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to us as that God that made all things, and that by his word, as well becauſe he did all by the moſt excellent reaſon, as becauſe he did it without the leaſt of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that to make ſuch a moſt glorious work as this World, he was only at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of one word, that is to ſay, it coſt him no more than his bare will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>And to follow the Hiſtory of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſince we have begun it, <hi>Moſes</hi> hath taught us, That that mighty Architect, to whom things coſt ſo little, was pleaſed to make them at ſeveral times, and by returns from thence where he had before given o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and to create the World in ſix days, to ſhew that he acted not through an impulſe
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56382:87"/> of neceſſity, or through a blind impetuoſity, as ſome Philoſophers have vainly imagined. The Sun emits at once (without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve) the power of all its rays; but God, who acts by intelligence, and with a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign liberty applies his Virtue and Power to what he pleaſeth, and juſt to ſo much too as he pleaſeth: And as in making the World by his word, he diſcovers that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can trouble or with-hold him, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it at ſeveral reſumptions, it is ſufficiently plain and evident to us that he is the Maſter of his Matter, of his Action, of all his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes, and that he hath not in any of his proceedings any other Rule but his Will, which is always right by it ſelf.</p>
               <p>This Conduct of Almighty God doth likewiſe ſhew to us, that every thing cometh immediately out of his hand. The People and the Philoſophers who have believed that the Earth mingled with Water, and aſſiſted (forſooth) with the warm beams of the Sun, had produced of it ſelf, through its own <hi>fecundity,</hi> Plants and Animals, were moſt groſly miſtaken. The Scriptures have made us to underſtand that the Elements are barren, if the word of God makes 'em not fruitful. Neither the Earth, nor the Water, nor the Air would ever have had Plants, or Animals, which we now ſee in them, if God, who had made and prepared the matter of them, had not alſo formed them by Almighty Will, and had not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to every thing the proper Seeds where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to multiply in all the ſucceeding Ages.</p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:56382:87"/>
               <p>Thoſe who ſee the Plants to take their birth and their increaſe by the heat of the Sun, might think that that is the Creator of them: but the Scripture hath plainly made it out to us, that the Earth was clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with Graſs, and all ſorts of Plants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever the Sun was made; that ſo we might be ſatisfied that on God alone was all dependence.</p>
               <p>It pleaſed that great Workmaſter to create Light, before he had put it into the form which he hath given it in the Sun and the Stars, becauſe he would inform and convince us, that theſe great and magnificent Lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which we would ſo willingly make Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, had by themſelves neither that curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſhining Matter, whereof they are now compoſed, nor that admirable form to which we ſee them now reduced.</p>
               <p>In a word, the account of the Creation, ſuch as <hi>Moſes</hi> has given us of it, diſcovers to us that great Myſtery of the true Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, that in God alone reſides abſolute Fullneſs and Power. Happy, Wiſe, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, alone ſufficient in himſelf, he acts without neceſſity as he acts without need, never ſtraitned nor conſtrained, nor puzzled with his matter wherewith he doth whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he will, becauſe he hath by his alone Will given to it the foundation of its Being. By this Sovereign right he turns it, he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions it, he moves it without pain or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs, all things depend immediately on him, and according to the order eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in Nature, one thing depends on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for inſtance, the birth and increaſe of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56382:88"/> Plants, on the heat of the Sun, it is becauſe that that ſame God who hath made all the parts of the Univerſe, was pleaſed to link them one to another, and ſo to make his Wiſdom the more conſpicuous and viſible by that marvellous train of Cauſes.</p>
               <p>But whatſoever the Holy Scripture tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches us about the Creation of the World, it is nothing comparatively to what it ſays con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Man.</p>

                  <hi>Let there be light; Let there be a firmament in the midſt of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters; and let the waters be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear, and let it bring forth graſs; and let there be lights in the firmament of Heaven, to divide the day from the night; let the waters bring forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly the moving creature that hath life; and let the Earth bring forth the living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture after his kind:</hi> But when he comes to make man, <hi>Moſes</hi> gives him then a new Language, <hi>Let us make man,</hi> ſays he, <hi>in our Image, after our lik neſs.</hi> It is no longer that imperious and commanding word; it is a word more mild, but yet no whit leſs power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and efficacious. God held a Council within himſelf; He excites himſelf, as it were, to ſhew us that the work he was going then to make, exceeded all the other part of the Creation, which he had already fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let us make man.</hi> God ſpeaks within himſelf; he ſpeaks to ſome one who doth as himſelf; to ſome ſome one whoſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56382:88"/> and Image man is; he ſpeaks to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is his ſecond ſelf; he ſpeaks to him by whom all things were made, to him who ſays in the Goſpel,<note place="margin">John 5. v. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Whatſoever the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth, theſe alſo doth the Son likewiſe.</hi> In ſpeaking to his Son, or with his Son, he ſpeaks at the ſame time with the Holy Ghoſt, All-complying, Equal, and Co-eternal one to the other.</p>
               <p>'Tis an unheard of thing in all the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Sacred Scriptures, that any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than God ſhould ſpeak of himſelf in the plural number; <hi>let us make.</hi> God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Scripture ſpeaks thus but two or three times, and this extraordinary lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage began to appear when he was engaged in making Man.</p>
               <p>When God changes his way of ſpeaking, and in ſome ſort of conduct too, it is not to be ſuppoſed that he changes in himſelf; but he demonſtrates to us that he is going to begin, according to his Eternal Council, a new order of things.</p>
               <p>Thus Man, ſo highly exalted above all other Creatures, whoſe Generation <hi>Moſes</hi> has deſcribed to us, is formed in a manner as altogether new, and different from them. The Trinity begins to declare it ſelf, in the making a reaſonable Creature, whoſe Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Operations are an imperfect Image of thoſe Eternal Operations, by which God is fruitful in himſelf.</p>
               <p>The word of Council which God makes uſe of, points to us, that the Creature which was going to be made, was the only One here below capable of acting by Council
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:56382:89"/> and Intelligence. All the reſt is no leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary. Hitherto we have not ſeen in the Hiſtory of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> the finger of God apply'd to a corruptible matter. To frame and faſhion Man's Body, He himſelf takes up ſome of the duſt of the ground,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. v. 7.</note> and that duſt being managed by ſuch a hand, receives the moſt beautiful form that ever yet was ſeen in the World.</p>
               <p>This particular attention, which was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in God, when he made Man, ſhews us that he hath a particular regard for him, tho' otherwiſe every thing is conducted im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by his infinite Wiſdom.</p>
               <p>But the manner how he formed the Soul, is ſtill much more marvellous and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; he derives not that from Matter; he inſpires it from on high; it is the breath of life which proceeds from himſelf.</p>
               <p>When he created the Beaſts, he ſaid, <hi>Let the waters bring forth ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ndantly every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creature;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 1.20.24.</note> and in this manner he crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Sea-Monſters, and every living and moving Soul which was to fill the Waters: He ſaith alſo, <hi>Let the Earth bring forth the living Creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beaſt of the Ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th after his kind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus had thoſe living Souls of a brutal and beſtial Life their Being, to which God gives for all their Actions nothing but Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions dependent on the Body. God takes them out of the Womb of the Waters and of the Earth; but this Soul, whoſe Life ought to be an Imitation of his own, which was to live as himſelf, by Reaſon and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence;
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:56382:89"/> which was to be united to him in Contemplation and in Love, and which for this reaſon was to be made after his own Image and Likeneſs: This Soul, I ſay, was incapable of being derived from matter. God in making matter can eaſily form a beautiful and curious Body; but in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſort he turns and faſhions it, he will never find his Image and Reſemblance in it. The Soul, made after his Image, and which can be happy in poſſeſſing him, muſt be produced by a new Creation; it muſt come from above, and this is that <hi>breath of life,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 2.7.</note> which God breathed from his own Mouth.</p>
               <p>Let us always remember that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks to carnal Men by ſenſible Images of the moſt pure and intellectual Truths. But let us not imagine that God breaths after the manner of Animals; let us not ſuppoſe our Souls to be a ſubtil Air, nor a flitting Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por. The Breath which God inſpires, and which bears in it ſelf the Image of himſelf, is neither Air nor Vapor. Let us not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that our Souls are a portion of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. Nature, as ſome Philoſophers have vainly dream'd. God is not a Whole to be divided. Tho' there ſhould be parts in God, yet they ſhould not be made. For the Creator, the uncreated Being ſhould not be compoſed of Creatures. The Soul is made, and ſo made, that it is no part of the divine Nature, but only a thing made after the Image and Reſemblance of the divine Nature, a thing which is always to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him that formed it; this is what is
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:56382:90" rendition="simple:additions"/> underſtood by that divine Breath, it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to us that Spirit of Life.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee how Man was formed. God alſo out of him formed a Companion that he deſign'd to give him. All Mankind is born by one ſingle Marriage, that ſo how diſperſed and multiplied ſoever they have been, they may be for ever one ſingle and the ſame Family.</p>
               <p>Our firſt Parents thus formed, were placed in that delicious Garden, which was called <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> God was only obliged to himſelf for rendering his Image happy.</p>
               <p>He gave to Man a precept, to make him ſenſible that he had a Maſter; a precept joyned to a thing that was ſenſible, becauſe Man was made with Senſes: A Precept that was eaſy, becauſe he would have his Life as commodious as it ſhould be innocent.</p>
               <p>But Man kept not this Command tho' it was of ſo eaſy an Obſervance; he hearkens to the tempting Spirit, and he hearkens to himſelf alſo, inſtead of fixing his attention on God only: So that his Ruine was inevitable: But here we muſt conſider it in its original State as well as in its after-circumſtances.</p>
               <p>God in the beginning had made his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Spirits pure and ſeparate from all matter. He that made nothing but what was good, had created them all in Holineſs, and they might have ſecured their Felicity, by giving themſelves up voluntarily to their Creator. But whatſoever is derived out of nothing is defective. One part of theſe Angels ſuffered themſelves to be ſeduced by their own ſelf-Love. Unhappy Creatures,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:56382:90"/> who would be pleaſed in themſelves, and not in God. They loſt in a Moment all that He had given them. Strange effect of Sin! Thoſe Holy Creatures of Light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Spirits of Darkneſs: They ceaſed any longer to have any Light in them but what turned it ſelf into malicious Craftineſs. An Envious Malignity poſſeſſed them in the room of their former Lovingneſs and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: Their natural Greatneſs was nothing but Pride: Their Felicity was changed into that conſolation of getting to themſelves Companions in their Miſery, and their moſt delightful Exerciſes were to be miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably imployed in tempting Men. The moſt perfect of them all, who had alſo been the moſt proud, found himſelf the greateſt evil doer, as he was the moſt miſerable: <hi>Man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 8.5.</note> 
                  <hi>whom God had made but little lower than the Angels,</hi> in uniting him to a Body, became a Spirit ſo perfect as if he had been an Object of Jealouſy; he was reſolved to enſnare him in his Rebellion, afterwards to envelop him in his Ruine. We will take notice how he ſpeaks to him, and ſearch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bottom of his Artifices. He addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes himſelf to <hi>Eve,</hi> as to the weaker Veſſel; but in the perſon of <hi>Eve</hi> he ſpeaks to her Husband as well as to her,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.1.</note>

After ſhe had eaten of that <hi>Fruit which was ſo pleaſant to the Eye, and ſo much to be deſired to make one wiſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 6.</note> ſhe preſented ſome of it to her Husband, and 'twas a very dangerous aſſault upon him. Example and Complaiſance fortified the Temptation; he was beguiled into the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of the Tempter, being ſo well ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded; a deceitful Curioſity, a flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thought of Pride, the ſecret Pleaſure of acting by himſelf, and according to the pulſe of his own Inclinations, drew him in, and miſerably was he cheated: He reſolved to make a dangerous tryal of his Liberty, and he taſted, with the Fruit forbidden him, the fatal Sweetneſs and Pleaſure of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Fancy: The Senſes too mingled their attractions to this new Charm; he follows them; he ſubmits himſelf to them, and he who before was the Maſter of, is now become a Captive to them.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time he finds a change in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing. The Earth no longer ſmiles

God who had made all things for his Happineſs, in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment turned all things to his miſerable pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. He was become a Torment to himſelf, he that before ſo much loved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The Rebellion of his Senſes makes him ſee ſomewhat in himſelf (he knows not what) that is very vile and deſpicable. 'Tis now no longer that firſt work of the Creator, wherein every thing was beautiful; Sin has formed a new work which he would fain conceal, if poſſible. Man could no longer ſupport his Shame, but wiſhed he had been able to cover it even with his own Eyes. But God was ſtill much more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable to him. That great God who had made him after his own Image and Likeneſs, and who had indued him with Underſtanding as a neceſſary relief to his Mind, was pleaſed to diſcover himſelf to him under a ſenſible Form.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> 8.</note> He ſought out the moſt recluſe places of the Garden to hide himſelf from him, who before was all his Joy and all his Happineſs. His Conſcience accuſes him before ever God ſpeaks a word, and his miſerable frivolous Excuſes do but ſerve the more abſolutely to confound him. He muſt die; the remedy of an immortal State is taken away from him, and a moſt dreadful Death, which is that of the Soul,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56382:92"/> is typiſyed to him by that Corporeal to which he is condemned.</p>
               <p>And behold here was our Sentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced incluſively in his. God, who had reſolved to reward his Obedience in all his deſcendent Poſterity, as ſoon as he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted and fell from him, condemns him, and ſtrikes him, not only in his own Perſon, but likewiſe in all his Seed, as in the moſt quick and tendereſt part of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: We were all accurſed in our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; our Birth is depraved and corrupted in its very Source.</p>
               <p>We ſhall not here examine thoſe terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rules of the divine Juſtice, by which the whole Race of Mankind was accurſed in its firſt Original. Let us adore the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, who regards all men as one ſingle man in him from whom he would have all men to proceed. Let us alſo look upon our ſelves, as degraded in our rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Father, as for ever made miſerable by the Sentence which condemned him, as being baniſhed with him, and excluded out of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> where we might have all been born.</p>
               <p>The Rules of humane Juſtice may help us a little to enter into the profoundneſs of the divine Juſtice, whereof they are but a Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, but they cannot diſcover to us the depth of that Abyſs. Let us believe that the Juſtice, as well as the Mercy of God, will not be meaſured by the poor ſcantling Rules of Men, and that the Effects of them both are much more extenſive, and much more ſecret.</p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:56382:92"/>
               <p>But though the Severities of God upon Mankind are dreadful and terrible to us, yet let us admire how preſently he turns our Eyes to an Object far more pleaſant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful. Under the Figure of the Serpent, whoſe crooked turnings and creepings on its Belly, were a lively Image of the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Inſinuations, and deceitful Artifices of the evil Spirit, God ſhews to our Mother <hi>Eve</hi> her Enemy conquered,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.14, 15.</note> and diſcovers to her that bleſſed Seed by which her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror ſhall have his <hi>bruiſed Head,</hi> that is to ſay, ſhall ſee his Pride taken down, and his Empire deſtroyed over the whole Earth.</p>
               <p>That bleſſed Seed was Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of a Virgin; that Jeſus Chriſt in whom the alone <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned, becauſe he was to come from <hi>Adam</hi> in a Divine man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, conceived not by Man, but by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>But before we were to have this Saviour given us, Mankind was obliged to know, through a long Experience, the need there was of ſuch a Help and Succour. Man was therefore left to himſelf, his Inclinations were vitiated, his Riots exceſſive, and Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity ſpread it ſelf over all the Earth.</p>
               <p>Then did God ſet himſelf to execute his Vengeance upon them, and he was reſolved it ſhould be ſuch an one as the Memory of Man ſhould never forget: It was that of the univerſal Deluge, the remembrance of which does effectually ſtill continue in all Nations, as well as that of their Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which brought it.</p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:56382:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Let not Men henceforward think that the World was of it ſelf, and that what hath been, ſhall always be as of it ſelf. God, who made all things, and by whom all things ſubſiſt, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> going to drown both Man and Beaſt, that is to ſay, he was going to deſtroy the faireſt part of the Creation.</p>
               <p>There was no need of any but himſelf, to deſtroy what he had made by a word of his Mouth; but he found it moſt worthy of himſelf to make his Creatures ſerve as an Inſtrument to his Vengeance, and he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore calls the Waters to commit their Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences on the Earth, which was already full of Wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>However he found one Man juſt among them. God, before he ſaved him from the Deluge of the Waters, had preſerved him, by his Grace, from the Deluge of Iniquity. His Family was reſerved to re-people the Earth, which was then but an immenſe So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude. By the provident Care of that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Man, God ſaved the Animals, that ſo Man might underſtand that they were made for him, and ſubjected to his Empire by their Creator.</p>
               <p>The World ſeem'd to have a new Frame again, and the Earth came once more from the Boſom of the Waters; but in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation, there remains an eternal Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Divine Juſtice. Unto the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge all Nature was more ſtrong and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: By that vaſt quantity of Waters which God ſent upon the Earth, and by the long abode it made there, the Sapp, which was encloſed in it, was altered, the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:56382:93" rendition="simple:additions"/> Air, full of an exceſſive Humidity, fortified the principles and ſeeds of Corruption; and the firſt Conſtitution of the Univerſe finding it ſelf weak and languiſhing, Man's Life, which held out to almoſt a thouſand years, began to diminiſh by little and little; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Herbs nor Fruits had any longer their firſt Strength and Efficacy, and therefore Man was to have given him a more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Nouriſhment in the Fleſh of Beaſts.</p>
               <p>Thus by degrees the remains of the firſt Inſtitution began to wear off and to be effa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; and changed Nature advertiſed Man that God was no more the ſame for him, ſince he had been ſo highly provoked by his manifold and great Tranſgreſſions.</p>
               <p>Now that extream long Life of the firſt Men,<note place="margin">Maneth. Beroſ. Heſtiae. Nic. Damaſ. &amp; al. apud Joſeph. ant. l. <hi>4.</hi> Heſiod. Op. &amp; al.</note> obſerved in the Annals of the People of God, hath not been unknown to other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and their antient Traditions have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Memory of them. Death which now came on, made Men to feel a more ready Vengeance: And as they ſtill every day did more and more plunge themſelves in Wickedneſs, it was juſt that they ſhould be alſo, as I may ſo ſpeak, every day more and more overwhelmed in their Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments.</p>
               <p>The bare change of their Diet might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to them how much their eſtate was impaired, ſince that in being grown weaker, they became at the ſame time more voracious and more ſanguinary.</p>
               <p>Before the time of the Deluge, the Food which Men lived on without violence in the Fruits that fell of themſelves, and in the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:56382:94"/> Herbs which alſo withered ſo quickly, was doubtleſs ſome remains of the firſt Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and of the Pleaſure to which we were formed. But now, to feed us, we muſt ſhed Blood, notwithſtanding the Horror where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it naturally ſhocks us: And all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacies we now uſe about our Tables, can ſcarcely conceal from us the nauſeous Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſes which we are forced to eat to ſatisfy us.</p>
               <p>And yet this is but the leaſt part of our Miſeries. Our already ſhortned Lives are ſtill more abridged by the Violences com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted on one another. Man, who in the Infancy of Time was ſeen to be very tender of the Lives of Beaſts, by a vitious cuſtom, makes nothing now of taking away the Life of his own Reſemblance, and fellow Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It was in vain that God forbad the ſhedding of Blood preſently after the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge;<note place="margin">Gen. 9.4, 5.</note> in vain, to ſave ſome <hi>Veſtigia</hi> of the firſt ſweetneſs of our Nature, by permitting us to eat of the Fleſh of Beaſts: in vain, I ſay, did he reſerve the Blood thereof. Murders are multiplied without meaſure.

But Wars were not yet found out. It was after the Deluge that thoſe Ravagers of Provinces appeared, who were called Conquerors, who being puſhed on by the Glory of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, have ſlain ſo much innocent

Since then Ambition tramples on the Lives of Men, without any Bounds; they are come to that paſs now, as to kill one another in cool Blood without any Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred: The perfection of Honour, and the braveſt of all Arts, has been for the Sparks to boaſt they have kill'd their Men.</p>
               <p>Such were the beginnings of the World, as the Hiſtory of <hi>Moſes</hi> repreſents them to us: Beginnings, happy at firſt, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards full of infinite Evils and Miſchiefs, in relation to that God who made all things, always admirable; ſuch, in fine, as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in revolving them in our Minds, by conſidering the Univerſe, and Mankind, always under the hand of the Creator, brought out of nothing by his Word, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by his Goodneſs, governed by his Wiſdom, puniſhed by his Juſtice, delivered by his Mercy, and always ſubject to his Power.</p>
               <p>The World is no ſuch thing as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers apprehended, formed, according to ſome, by a fortuitous Concourſe of firſt Bodies, or which, according to the wiſeſt of them, hath fitted its Matter to its Author, who by conſequence depends not on it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ground of his being, nor in his firſt Eſtate, and who tyes it up to certain Laws which he himſelf cannot violate.</p>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56382:95"/> he hath ſhown unto us, hath far another kind of Power: He can do, and undo, what, and howſoever, he pleaſeth: He preſcribeth Laws to Nature, and deſtroys them again when ere it pleaſeth him.</p>
               <p>If, to make himſelf known in times, when the Groſs of Mankind had forgot him, he hath wrought aſtoniſhing Miracles, and hath forced Nature to ſtart from its moſt conſtant Laws, he thereby ſtill hath continued to ſhew, that he was the abſolute Maſter of them, and that his Will is the only Chain that preſerves the Order of the World.</p>
               <p>'Tis exactly what Men had forgot: The ſtability of ſo curious an Order, ſerved now to perſuade them that that Order had been always, and that he was from himſelf; whereby they were induced to adore either the World in general, or the Stars, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, and in ſhort, all thoſe great Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which compoſe it. God therefore hath teſtified to Mankind a Goodneſs worthy of himſelf, in reverſing upon ſome moſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and particular Occaſions, that Order, which not only had little effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, becauſe they were uſed to them, but which brought them (ſo far were they deluded by their Blindneſs) to imagine there was an Eternity and Independence in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what beſides God.</p>

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56382:95"/> by that means gives us the true Idea of the ſupreme Empire of God, the Almighty Maſter of his Creatures, either to hold them in ſubjection to thoſe general Laws which he hath eſtabliſhed, or to give them others from them, when he judges it neceſſary, by ſome ſurprizing ſtroke to awaken and rouſe up ſleeping Mankind.</p>
               <p>This is the God whom <hi>Moſes</hi> hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to us in his Writings, as the only one whom we ought to ſerve; this is the God whom the Patriarchs worſhipped before <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> in one word, the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and of <hi>Jacob,</hi> to whom our Father <hi>Abraham</hi> was willing to ſacrifice his only Son, whoſe High-Prieſt was <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> the Type of Jeſus Chriſt, to whom our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Noah</hi> ſacrificed when he came out of the Ark, whom Righteous <hi>Abel</hi> acknowledged in his offering to him that which was moſt dear and pretious to him, whom <hi>Seth</hi> (given to <hi>Adam</hi> in the room of his ſlain <hi>Abel</hi>) made known to his Children, being called alſo the Sons of God; whom <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf had ſhewn to his Poſterity, as that great Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, out of whoſe Hands he had been ſo lately come, and who alone could put an end to the Calamities of his wretched Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity.</p>

                  <note place="margin">II. <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchy.</note>Now, as the People of God, under the Patriarch <hi>Abraham,</hi> took up a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated Form, it is, my Lord neceſſary, to ſtay you a while upon the Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that great Man.</p>
               <p>He was born about three hundred and fifty years after the Deluge, at a time when Man's Life, though reduced to much ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Limits, was yet very long. <hi>Noah</hi> was but newly dead, <hi>Shem</hi> his eldeſt Son was then living, and <hi>Abraham</hi> might with him paſs almoſt all his Life.</p>
               <p>Repreſent then to your ſelf the World as New, and alſo, if I may be admitted to ſay ſo, all wet ſtill with the Waters of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, when Men ſo near to the beginning of things, only needed to know the Unity of God, and the Service which was due to him from Tradition, which was preſerv'd from <hi>Adam,</hi> and from <hi>Noah.</hi> A Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, beſides, ſo conformable to the illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Reaſon, as it ſeemed that a Truth ſo clear and important might never be clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, nor forgotten by Mankind. Such was the firſt Eſtate of Religion, which continued down to <hi>Abraham,</hi> where to know the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, Men were only to conſult their Reaſon and their Memory.</p>
               <p>But Reaſon was weak and corrupted, and proportionably as Men were at further di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the beginning of things, they confounded the Ideas which they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:56382:96" rendition="simple:additions"/> from their Anceſtors. The ſtupid and ill-inſtructed Youth, would no longer believe their old decrepit Grandfathers, whom they ſcarcely knew after ſo many Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations; and humane Senſe grown bruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, could then no longer raiſe it ſelf up to intellectual things, and Men reſolving only to worſhip what they could ſee, Idolatry thus ſpread it ſelf over all the Face of the Earth.</p>
               <p>The Spirit that had deceived the firſt Man, taſted then all the Fruit of his Seduction, &amp; beheld the intire effect of that Word, <hi>You ſhall be as Gods.</hi> From the moment that he ſpoke it, he deſigned to confound in Man the Idea of God with that of the Creature, and to divide a Name, whoſe Majeſty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in being incommunicable. His Project ſucceeded. Men buried in Fleſh and Blood, had however retained an obſcure Idea of the divine Power, which kept it ſelf up by its own Force and Energy; but yet, which was ſo confuſed with the Images that came into their own Heads and Fancies, that it made them to fall down and worſhip every thing wherein appeared any Activity or any Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Thus the Sun and the Stars, which are ſeen at ſo vaſt a diſtance, the Fire and the Elements, whoſe Effects were ſo univerſal, were the firſt Objects of the publick Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Great Kings and mighty Conquerors, who could do any thing they pleaſed on the Earth, the Authors of Inventions, which were profitable to humane Life, had ſoon after divine Honours paid to them.<note place="margin">15<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:56382:97"/> to their Senſes; their Senſes decided all things, and in ſpight of their Reaſon made all the Gods which they worſhipped here below.</p>
               <p>How diſtant then did man appear from his firſt Inſtitution, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="154"/> and how ſadly was the Image of God defaced in him!

And that prodigious propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity he had to ſubject himſelf to every thing elſe but to his natural Lord, did it not too apparently ſhew the ſtrange hand by which the Workmanſhip of God had been ſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably altered in the mind of Man, that ſcarce was there any Footſtep of it to be found in him? Puſhed on by that blind Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion which abſolutely ſwayed him, he plunged himſelf into Idolatry, and nothing could ſtay him. So great a Miſchief made a very ſtrange Progreſs. For fear leſt all Mankind might be infected, and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God be utterly extinguiſhed, that great God, called from on high his Servant <hi>Abraham,</hi> in whoſe Family he reſolved to eſtabliſh his Worſhip, and preſerve the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Faith, as well of the Creation of the World, as of the particular Providence with which humane things are governed.</p>

We have ſeen that <hi>Abraham</hi> followed that way of living which was led by his Anceſtors, before that all the World was reduced into Kingdoms. He reigned in his Family, with which he embraced the paſtoral Life, ſo much renowned for its ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and Innocence; rich in his Flocks, in his Slaves, and in his Silver; but without Lands and Demeans; and yet he lived in a ſtrange Kingdom, but was reſpected, and independent as a Prince. His Piety and his Uprightneſs, protected by God, attracted that reſpect to him. He treated as an Equal with Kings, who ſought his Alliance, and it
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:56382:98"/> was from thence came that antient Opinion, that he made himſelf a King. But tho' his life was ſimple and peaceable, yet under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood he the Arts of War, but then it was only to defend his oppreſt Allies.<note place="margin">Gen. 14.</note> He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended them, and revenged them by a moſt ſignal Victory: He reſtored to them all their Riches re-taken from their Enemies, without reſerving any thing but the Tythe, which he offered up to God, and the <hi>Quota</hi> which belonged to the Auxiliary Troops which he had brought along with him to the Battle. But after ſo great a ſervice, he refuſed the Preſents of the Kings with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd Magnanimity, and could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that any man ſhould boaſt he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched <hi>Abraham.</hi> He would be indebted to none but to his God, who had protected him, and whom he ſolely followed with a moſt perfect Faith and Obedience.</p>
               <p>Guided by that Faith, he had forſaken his Native Countrey, to come to a Land which God had ſhewn him. God who had called him, and made him worthy of his Alliance, Articled it upon theſe Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>He declared to him that he would be his God,<note place="margin">Gen. 12.17.</note> and the God of his Poſterity, that is to ſay, he would be their Protector, and that they ſhould ſerve him as the only God, the Creator of Heaven and Earth.</p>
               <p>He promiſed him a Land ('twas that of <hi>Canaan</hi>) to ſerve for a fixed habitation to his Poſterity,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and for a place for his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>He had no Children, and his Wife <hi>Sarah</hi>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:56382:98"/> was barren. God ſwore to him by Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and by his Eternal Veracity,<note place="margin">Gen. 12.2.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But the moſt remarkable Article of all of the Divine Promiſe was this, All the People ſhould preſently fall into Idolatry. God promiſed to this Holy Patriarch, that in him, and in his Seed ſhould all thoſe blind Nations that had forgotten their Creator, be bleſſed, that is to ſay, re-called to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him,<note place="margin">Gen. 12.3.18.18.</note> wherein the true Benediction is to be found.</p>
               <p>By that promiſe was <hi>Abraham</hi> made the Father of all the faithful, and his Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was choſen to be the ſource from whence the Bleſſing was to go upon all the Earth.</p>
               <p>In that Promiſe was included the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſo often foretold to our Fathers, but always foretold as Him who was to be the Saviour of all the Gentiles, and of all the people of the World.</p>
               <p>Thus that bleſſed Branch, promiſed to <hi>Eve,</hi> became alſo the Branch and Cion of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the foundation of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and theſe the Conditions of it.<note place="margin">Gen. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> received the ſign of it in Circumciſion, a Ceremony whoſe proper effect was to ſhew that that Holy Man belonged to God, with all his Family.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> was childleſs when God began to bleſs his Race: And God left him for ſeveral years without giving him any: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:56382:99"/> he had <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> who was to be the Father of a great People,<note place="margin">Gen. 12.15.2.16.3, 4, 17.20.21.13.</note> but not of that choſen People ſo much promiſed to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> The Father of the choſen People was to proceed from him, and from his wife <hi>Sarah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 21.2.</note> who then was barren. At length when <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was thirteen years old, came this ſo much deſired Son; he was called <hi>Iſaac,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Laughter,</hi> a Son of Joy, a Son of Miracle, a Son of Promiſe, who ſhewed by his Birth, that the true Children of God are born of Grace.</p>
               <p>He, this Child of bleſſing, was grown to ſome conſiderle ſtatute, and of an age from which his Father might hope to have other Children of him, when of a ſudden God commands him to offer him up as a Sacrifice.<note place="margin">Gen. 22.</note>
               </p>
               <p>To what a tryal is Faith expoſed! <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> carrys <hi>Iſaac</hi> to the Mountain which God had ſhewn him, and he went to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that Son in whom alone God promiſed to make him the Father both of his People, and of the <hi>Meſſiah. Iſaac</hi> preſented his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Boſom to the Sword, which his Father held out ready to ſtrike him. God being ſatisfied with the obedience both of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son, demanded no further of them. After thoſe two great Men had given to the World ſo lively and fair an Image of the voluntary Oblation of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and in their Souls had taſted if the bitterneſſes of his Croſs, they were eſteemed truly worthy of being his Anceſtors.<note place="margin">Gen. 22.28.</note> 
                  <hi>Abraham's</hi> faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs made God confirm to him all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and bleſſed anew, not only his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:56382:99"/> but alſo in his Family all the Nations of the World.</p>
               <p>In effect, he continued his protection to <hi>Iſaac</hi> his Son, and to <hi>Jacob</hi> his Grand-child. They were his imitators, and adhered as he did, to the Antient Faith, to the Antient manner of living, which was the Paſtoral; to the Antient Government of Mankind, where every Father of a Family was a Prince in his own Houſe.</p>
               <p>Thus in the Changes and Revolutions continually made among Men, the Holy Antiquity revived in the Religion, and in the conduct of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>God did alſo repeat to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> the ſame Promiſes which he had made to <hi>Abraham;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 25.11.26.4.28.14.</note> and as he called himſelf the God <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſo he took upon him the name of the God of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and of the God of <hi>Jacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Under his protection thoſe three great Men began to dwell in the Land of <hi>Caanan,</hi> but as ſtrangers, and without poſſeſſing there <hi>a foot of ground,</hi> until the Famine brought <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where his Children being multiplied became ſoon after a great Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">Acts 7.5.</note> as God had promiſed him.</p>
               <p>But tho' this People, whom God made to be born in his Covenant, were to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged by Generation, and that the Bleſſing was to follow the Blood, yet this great God failed not mark out to them the Election of his Grace: For after he had choſen <hi>Abraham</hi> from among the Nations, out of the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> he choſe

                  <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and from the two Twins of <hi>Iſaac</hi> he choſe <hi>Jacob,</hi> to whom afterwards he gave the name of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jacob</hi> had twelve Sons, who were the twelve Patriarchs, heads of the twelve Tribes. All were entred into the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; but <hi>Judah</hi> was choſen from amidſt all his Brethren to be the Father of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Father of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> ſo much promiſed to his Anceſtors.</p>
               <p>The time was come that the ten Tribes being cut off from the People of God for their Infidelity, the Poſterity of <hi>Abrah<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Jacob</hi> in his Spirit ſaw the Myſtery of this Election juſt before he dyed, when his Sons ſtood round about his Bed to receive the bleſſing of ſo good a Father.

               </p>
               <p>The reſt of the Prophecy is about the Countrey which the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> ſhall poſſes in the Holy Land. But the laſt words, as we have ſeen them, (howſoever we take them) ſignifies nothing but him who was to be the Ambaſſador of God, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter and Interpreter of his Will, the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of his Promiſes, and the King of the new People, that is to ſay, the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> or the Anointed of the Lord.</p>

               </p>
               <p>All the Terms of the Prophecy are clear: there is only the word <hi>Scepter,</hi> which the common uſe of out Tongue might make us take for the only Royalty; whereas in the Sacred Language it ſignifies in general, Power, Authourity, and Magiſtracy. That uſe of the word <hi>Scepter</hi> runs through all the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:56382:101"/> pages of the Scripture: It plainly appears alſo in the Prophecy of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch means, that in the days of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> all Authority ſhall be put to an end in the Houſe of <hi>Judah,</hi> which imports the total ruine of a State.</p>
               <p>Thus the times of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> are noted out to us here by a double change. By the former, the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> and of the <hi>Jews</hi> is threatned with its laſt ruine: By the latter, there was a new Kingdom to be ſet up, not of one ſingle People, but of all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, over whom the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was to be the head and hope.</p>
               <p>In the Style of Holy Writ, the <hi>Jews</hi> are called in the ſingular number, and by way of eminence,<note place="margin">Iſa. 65. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Rom. 10.21. Iſa. 2.2, 3.49.6.18.51.4, 5.</note>

               </p>
               <p>This great Prophecy comprehends in a few words all the Hiſtory of the Jewiſh Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and of Chriſt our Saviour, who was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to them. It points out to us all the courſe of the people of God, and it effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly continues to this day.</p>
               <p>Therefore I pretend not to make a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary of it to You; there is no need for You to have one, ſince by barely obſerving their courſe, You will eaſily ſee the ſence of the Oracle unvailed of it ſelf, and that the very events themſelves will be their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters.</p>

               <p>So that it was four hundred and thirty years before God gave his people the Land which he had promiſed them.</p>
               <p>He was reſolved to accuſtom his Elect to rely upon his Promiſe, being aſſured that it ſhould be fulfilled either ſooner or later, and always at the exact time appointed by his Eternal Providence.</p>
               <p>The Iniquities of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> both whoſe Land and Spoils he was reſolved to beſtow on them, were not yet full, as he declared to <hi>Abraham,</hi>

               <p>There was time to be given for this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to multiply, that ſo they might be able to fill the Land which was deſigned them, and to poſſeſs it by force,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> in rooting out thoſe Inhabitants who were accurſed by God.</p>
               <p>He was willing to have them undergo in <hi>Aegypt</hi> a hard and inſupportable Captivity, that ſo being delivered by unheard of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies, they might be in love with their Reſcuer, and eternally celebrate his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
               <p>This was the order of the Councils of God, ſo as himſelf has revealed them to us, to teach us to fear him, to adore him, to love him, and to wait with Faith and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>

               <p>The time being come, he hearkens to the cries of his People, who were cruelly affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and he ſends <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to deliver his Children from thdr Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</p>
               <p>He makes himſelf known to that great Man, more than ever yet he had done to any Man living. He appears to him in a manner equally magnificent and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: he declares to him that He is that He is. All that is before him is but a ſhadow. <hi>I am,</hi>

               <p>I will not in retail give you an account of the Plagues of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> nor of the hardneſs of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s heart, nor of the paſſing over the red Sea, not of the Smoke, nor Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, the Trumpet ſounding, and the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Thundering and Noiſe that the People heard on Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> God there engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with his own hand upon two Tables of Stone the fundamental Precepts of Religion and Society. He dictated the reſt to <hi>Moſes</hi> with a loud Voice. To preſerve this Law in its ſtrength and vigour he was ordered to convene a venerable Aſſembly of ſeventy Elders,<note place="margin">Exod. 24.1.

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56382:102"/> of his Majeſty and Power.</p>
               <p>Till then God had given nothing by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which might ſerve as a Rule for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. The Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> only had Circumciſion, and the Ceremonies that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied it, for a Token of the Covenant which God hath contracted with that Elect Race. They were ſeparated by that ſign from the other People, who worſhipped falſe Gods: Now they kept themſelves in the Covenant of God by the remembrance they had of the Promiſes made to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and they were known as a People who ſerved the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and of <hi>Jacob.</hi> God was ſo ſtrangely forgotten, that it was neceſſary to make him diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the name of thoſe who had been his worſhippers, and of whom he was alſo the declared Protector.</p>
               <p>This great God was reſolved no longer to leave to the hare memory of Mankind the Myſtery of Religion, and of his Covenant. It was time to give ſtronger bars to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which overwhelmed the World, and was even like to extinguiſh the remains of natural Light in Men.</p>
               <p>Ignorance and blindneſs was moſt prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly increaſed ſince <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time. In his time, and a little after, the knowledge of God extended it ſelf into <hi>Paleſtine</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi>

The true God was no longer known in <hi>Egypt</hi> as the God of all the People of the World, but as <hi>The God of the Hebrews.</hi> They then worſhipped Beaſts, and even creeping things of the Earth. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing was God, excepting God himſelf, and the World which God had made for the manifeſtation of his Power, ſeemed now to be become a Temple of Idols. Mankind ſtragled ſo far as to adore its very Vices, and its Paſſions, and there is nothing to be wondered at in all this. There was no Power more Inevitable and Tyrannical than their own. Man accuſtomed to believe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing divine that was powerful, as he felt himſelf dragged on to a vice by a force that was invincible, he eaſily thought that that ſame force was ſomewhat out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo preſently made a God of it! 'Twas thence that unchaſt Love had ſo many Altars erected to it, and ſome impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities which are horrible even to name,<note place="margin">Levit. 20.23.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be mixed with their Sacrifices.</p>
               <p>Cruelty got into them too at the ſame time: Guilty Man, who was troubled at the ſenſe of his own wickedneſs, and looked on God as his Enemy, ſuppoſed he could no ways better appeaſe and reconcile him than by extraordinary Sacrifices. He muſt ſhed Man's Blood an mix it with that of Beaſts: a blind fear puſhed on Fathers to immolate their own Children, and to burn them to their Gods inſtead of Incenſe. Thoſe Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were common in the times of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:56382:103" rendition="simple:additions"/> and were but one part of thoſe horrid Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> whoſe vengeance God doth commit to the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>

               <p>Amidſt ſo great an Ignorance, Man came to fall down and worſhip even the work of his own hands.

The Tradition which preſerved it in their minds, tho' it was clear enough, and ſufficiently preſent, if we would have been attentive to it, was juſt ready to vaniſh and be gone. Prodigious Fables, and ſuch alſo as were as full of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety as Extravagance, took their place. The time was come where Truth but ill kept in the memory of men, could no longer keep
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:56382:104" rendition="simple:additions"/> it ſelf with being written, and God having beſides reſolved to form his people to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue by Laws more expreſs, and in a greater number, he was pleaſed at the ſame time to give them in writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſummoned to this work. That great Man recollected the Hiſtory of paſt Ages; That of <hi>Adam</hi> that of <hi>Noah,</hi> that of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> that of <hi>Jacob;</hi> that of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> or rather that of God himſelf, and of his admirable Works.</p>
               <p>He was not to ſearch far for the tradition of his Anceſtors. He was born a hundred Years after the Death of <hi>Jacob.</hi> The old Men of his time might have converſed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Years with that Holy Patriarch: The memory of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and the Miracles which God had wrought by that great Miniſter of the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> were yet freſh in their Minds. The Lives of three or four Men reached up even to <hi>Noah,</hi> who had ſeen the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> and, as I may ſo ſay, had touched the beginning of time and things.</p>
               <p>Thus the antient traditions of Mankind, and thoſe of the Family of <hi>Abraham</hi> were not hard to be collected; the Memory of them was ſtill alive; and we need not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if <hi>Moſes</hi> in his <hi>Geneſis</hi> ſpeaks of things that happened in the firſt Ages, as things certain, whoſe memorable Monuments are ſtill to be ſeen both in the neighbouring Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the time when <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> inhabited that Land, they had in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces erected the monuments of things which had happened to them. There is yet ſhewn there
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:56382:104" rendition="simple:additions"/> the places where the lived, the Wells they had dug and ſunk in thoſe dry and ſterile Countries to find their Families and their Flocks Water; the Mountains whereon they Sacrificed to Almighty God, and where he manifeſted himſelf to them; the Stones which they had laid on Heaps to ſerve as a memorial to Poſterity; the Tombs wherein their bleſſed Aſhes are depoſited: The memory of thoſe great Men were freſh, not only in all the Country, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in all the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> where many of thoſe famous Nations have ſtill remembred that they have come from their Race.</p>
               <p>So when the <hi>Hebrews</hi> entred into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Land, every place there did celebrate their Anceſtors; both the Towns and the Mountains, and the very Stones themſelves did there ſpeak of thoſe marvellous Men, and of thoſe aſtoniſhing Viſions, by which God had confirmed them in the antient and true belief.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who are ever ſo little conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in Antiquities, do know how curious the firſt times were, to erect and to preſerve ſuch Monuments, and how induſtriouſly careful Poſterity has been ſince to retain the occaſions of their ſetting of them up. 'Twas one of the ways of their writing Hiſtory; the Stones have ſince been better faſhioned and poliſhed; and Statues have ſucceeded after Pillars to great and ſolid Maſſes, which the firſt times erected.</p>
               <p>'Tis alſo very rational to believe that in the lineage, wherein was preſerved the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God, were alſo preſerved by writing
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:56382:105" rendition="simple:additions"/> the remembrances of antient times. For Men have never been without that care. At leaſt this is moſt certain, that they made Songs, which the Fathers taught their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; Songs which were ſung at their Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals and in their Aſſemblies, gave a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity to the remembrance of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable actions of the paſt Ages.</p>
               <p>From hence came Poetry, which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards changed into various forms and modes, the moſt antient whereof is ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in Odes, and thoſe heroick ways, uſed by all the Antients, and ſtill to this day by thoſe People who have not the uſe of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in Praiſing God and great Men.</p>
               <p>The ſtile of thoſe Songs is bold, extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, natural always in what it is fit, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent Nature in all its Tranſports, which for that reaſon is forced by the moſt lively and impetuous Sallies, diſengaged from theſe ordinary Bonds that are requiſite in an united Diſcourſe, confined beſides to juſt Numbers and Cadences, which advances their force, ſurprizes the Ear, ſeizes the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination, gives an Emotion to the Heart, and with more eaſe imprints it ſelf in the Memory.</p>
               <p>Among all the People of the World, none have ſo much uſed theſe kind of Songs as have the People of God. <hi>Moſes</hi> takes notice of a great many of them, which he denotes by the firſt Verſes, becauſe the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple knew the reſt.<note place="margin">

                  </gap> and Vengeance. Following Ages imitated him. 'Twas God and his marvellous Works were the Subject of thoſe Odes which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; God himſelf inſpired them, and it was only to the People of God that Poetry came truly by <hi>Enthuſiaſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jacob</hi> declared in that myſtical Language the Oracles which contained the Deſtiny of his twelve Sons, that ſo every Tribe might the more eaſily keep in Mind what particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly related to it, and learn to praiſe him, who was no leſs magnificent in his Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons than faithful in performing them.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the means made uſe of by God to preſerve, even down to <hi>Moſes,</hi> the remembrance of paſt tranſactions. That great Man inſtructed by all thoſe means, and raiſed upon high by the Holy Ghoſt, hath written the Works of God with an exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſimplicity which attracts belief and admiration, not only to himſelf, but even to Almighty God.</p>
               <p>He hath joined to paſt actions, which contained the original and antient Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the People of God, the wonders which God actually wrought for their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance. Of that he produces to the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> no other Witneſſes than their own Eyes. <hi>Moſes</hi> tells them not of things which were done in impenetrable retreats, and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Caves; he ſpeaks not in the Air; he particularizes and circumſtantiates every
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56382:106"/> thing, as a Man that fears not to be caught in an untruth. He grounds all their Laws, and their whole Republick on the wonders which they themſelves have ſeen. Thoſe wonders were nothing elſe but Nature chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged all on a ſudden on different occaſions for their deliverance, and the puniſhment of their Enemies; the Sea divided it ſelf in two, the Earth opened herſelf, heavenly Food, abundance of Water guſhing out of Rocks, by a ſtroke of the Rod, and the Heaven which gave them a viſible ſign to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their March, and ſuch like Miracles which they themſelves had ſeen for forty Years.</p>
               <p>The People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were no more intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, nor more ſubtil than other People, who being given up to their Senſes, could not have any conceptions of an Inviſible God. On the contrary, they were ſtupid and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious as much, if not more than any other People. But that inviſible God in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, made himſelf ſo ſenſible by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Miracles, and <hi>Moſes</hi> inculcated them with ſo much force, that at length that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual People were overcome by the pure Idea of a God who made all things by his word, of a God who who was only Spirit, Reaſon, and Intelligence.</p>
               <p>So that, whilſt Idolatry, ſo mightily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed ſince <hi>Abraham's</hi> time, was ſpread over all the Face of the Earth, the only Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of that Patriarch was free from it. Their Enemies bore that Teſtimony of them; and the People, where the truth of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not yet utterly aboliſhed and worn
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:56382:106" rendition="simple:additions"/> out, declared with aſtoniſhment, that <hi>there was not ſeen an Idol in</hi> Jacob, <hi>neither any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Preſages, nor Divinations, nor Witchcrafts; but they were a People who truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Lord their God, whoſe Power was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To fix and imprint in their minds the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of God, and the perfect Uniformity which he requires in his worſhip, <hi>Moſes</hi> often repeats, that in the promiſed Land this only God would chuſe out a place, in which alone the Feaſts and Sacrifices,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Numb.</hi> xii. xiv, xv, xvi, xvii, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> and all the publick Service ſhould be performed. Whilſt they were waiting for this deſired place, during the time the People wandered in the wilderneſs, <hi>Moſes</hi> built the Tabernacle, the Temple which was carried about, where the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> offered up their Prayers to God, who had made heaven and earth, and who did not diſdain (with reverence may I ſay it) to travel with them and to be their Guide.</p>
               <p>Upon this Principle of Religion, upon this Sacred Foundation was built all the Law; a Law holy, juſt, beneficent, honeſt, wiſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, and ſimple, which bound the Society of men among themſelves by the holy So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Man with God.</p>
               <p>To this Holy Inſtitution he added Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtical Ceremonies, Feaſts that recalled to mind the Remembrances of the Miracles, whereby the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered;<note place="margin">

               <p>To maintain the Religion and all the Traditions of the People of God among the twelve Tribes, one Tribe was choſen to which God gives in ſhare with the Tithes and Oblations, the care of Sacred things. <hi>Levi</hi> and his Children are themſelves conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to God as the Tenth of all his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

               <p>All the People learnt by heart that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Song by the order of God,<note place="margin">Deut. 31.19, 22.</note> and of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> That great Man after that died con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as a Man that had forgot nothing which might preſerve in the Memory of his People the Benefits and Precepts of God.

               <p>That great Man had not ſo much as the conſolation of entering into the promiſed Land: he only ſaw it from the top of a Mountain,<note place="margin">Numb. 20.12, 13.27.14.

               <p>There is nothing more obſervable in the Hiſtory of the People of God, than this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Prophets. They beheld men ſeparated from the reſt of the People by a retired Life, and by a particular Habit: they had Habitations where they were ſeen to live in a kind of Community,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 28.14. 1 Kings 19.19.

During thoſe unhappy times the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets proclaimed on all ſides loudly, both by Preaching and writings, the threatnings of Almighty God, and the Teſtimony they
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:56382:119"/> bore to his Truth. The writings they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed were in the Hands of all the People, and carefully kept in perpetual remembrance to future Ages. Thoſe People who continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed faithful to God, joined with them; and we ſee alſo part in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> where Idolatry ſo much prevailed,<note place="margin">Exod. 17.14.

               <p>Thus the Society of the People of God ſubſiſted always, the Prophets continued in it: a great number of the Faithful perſiſted boldly in the Law of God with them, and with <hi>the Prieſts, the Levites,</hi>

               <p>And yet, notwithſtanding the Prophets, nor the faithful Prieſts, nor the People join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them in the obſervance of the Law, that Idolatry which had deſtroyed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> did oft-times lead away even in <hi>Judah</hi> it ſelf, both the Princes and the People. Tho' the Kings had forgotten the God of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet he a long time bore with their Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities for the ſake of his Servant <hi>David,</hi> who was always preſent to his Eyes.

               <p>In the mean time the Altar was ſet up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the Temple rebuilt, the Walls of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> repaired.

               <p>God who brings all things to paſs in his own due time, had choſen this, to cauſe his extraordinary ways to ceaſe, that is to ſay, the Prophecies, in his People ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed for the future. He reſted about five hundred Years, even to the days of the Meſſiah.

               <p>But toward the end of thoſe times, in which God had reſolved to put an end to Prophecies, he ſeemed to be willing to ſhed abroad all his Illuminations, and to reveal all the Councels of his Providence; ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did he expreſs the Secrets of the Times to come.</p>

               <p>You ſee what God ſhewed to the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> a little before the Conqueſts of <hi>Carus,</hi> and the Re-building of the Temple. In the time of the building of it, he raiſed up the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:56382:128"/> Prophets <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zachariah:</hi> And pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after he ſent <hi>Malachi,</hi> who was to conclude the Prophecies of the antient Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>What was it that <hi>Zachariah</hi> did not ſee? One could almoſt ſay that the very Book of God's Decrees was laid open to that Prophet, and that there he read the whole Hiſtory of the People of God from the time of the Captivity.</p>
               <p>The Perſecutions of the Kings of <hi>Syria,</hi> and the Wars which they made upon <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> are all of them diſcovered to him in their very particulars.<note place="margin">Zach. 14.1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c.</note> He ſaw <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> taken, and ſack'd; a dreadful Pillage, and infinite Diſorders; the Peoples Flight into the Deſart, uncertain of their Condition, whether Life or Death; and at the very Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil of its laſt Deſolation, there does, all of a ſudden, a new Light appear to him. The Enemies are vanquiſhed; the Idols are thrown down in all the Holy Land. There is nothing but Peace and Plenty ſeen both in City and Country, and the Temple is revered in all the Eaſt.</p>
               <p>One remarkable Circumſtance of thoſe Wars is revealed to the Prophet; and that is, that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be betrayed by her own Children,<note place="margin">Zach. 14.13, 14, &amp;.</note> and that among her Enemies there ſhall a great many <hi>Jews</hi> be found.</p>
               <p>Sometimes he ſees a long Succeſſion of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity: <hi>Judah</hi> is full of Strength; the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms that oppreſſed it, are humbled; the Neighbours that were continually tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it,<note place="margin">P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>In the midſt of theſe Calamities there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears yet another, greater than all the reſt.

               <p>A Meſſenger is an Envoy: But behold here is an Envoy of a very wonderful Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; an Envoy who hath a Temple; an Envoy who is no leſs than God, and who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:56382:130"/> into the Temple as into his own Houſe; an Envoy in whom all the People delight, who cometh to make a new Covenant, and who for that reaſon is called the Meſſenger of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>'Twas therefore in the ſecond Temple that God ſent from God was to appear:<note place="margin">Mal. 3.1.4.5, 6.</note> But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Meſſenger comes before him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare his way for him. There we ſee the Meſſiah preceded by his Fore-runner. The Character of that Fore-runner is alſo diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Prophet. That was to be a new <hi>Elijah,</hi> remarkable for his Holineſs, for the Auſterity of his Life, for his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and for his Zeal.</p>
               <p>Thus the laſt Prophet of the antient Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſhews the firſt Prophet who was to come after him, that is to ſay, that <hi>Elijah,</hi> the Fore-runner of the Lord who was to appear. Until that time the People of God were to expect no more Prophets: The Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> was to be ſufficient for them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore does <hi>Malachi</hi> ſhut up all with theſe words, <hi>Remember ye the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>my Servant, which I commanded unto him in</hi> Horeb. <hi>for all</hi> Iſrael,<note place="margin">Mal. 4.4, 6, 6.</note>

               <p>To this Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> God had joyned the Prophets, who had ſpoken in conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and the Hiſtory of the People of God made by the ſame Prophets, in which were confirmed, by viſible experiences, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Threatnings of the Law. Every
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:56382:130"/> thing was very carefully and diſtinctly writ; every thing digeſted by the order of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular times; and this was what God left for the Inſtruction of his People, when he cauſed the Prophecies to ceaſe.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Inſtructions wrought a wonderous change in the Manners of the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>

               <p>Wherefore from that time they were no more ſeen to return to Idolatry, to which they were ſo ſtrangely inclined before.

               </p>

'Tis thus expreſſed, <hi>That the</hi> Jews <hi>and the Prieſts were well pleaſed that</hi> Simon <hi>ſhould be their Governor and High-Prieſt for ever, until there ſhould ariſe a faithful Prophet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The People uſed from the beginning to a Theocracy, or divine Government, and knowing that ſince the time of <hi>David</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet upon the Throne by the order and appointment of God, the Soveragain Power belonged to his Houſe, to whom it was to be at laſt ſurrend'red at the time of the Meſſiah, puts expreſly this Reſtriction to the Power which he had given to his High-Prieſts, and continued to live under them in the hopes and expectation of that Chriſt which had been ſo often promiſed.</p>
               <p>Thus did that Kingdom, which was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely free, make uſe of its Prerogative, and provided for its Government. The Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Jacob,</hi> by the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and by the reſt who were ranged under its Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards, preſerved themſelves like a Body of a State, and independently and quietly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the Land which had been aſſigned to them.</p>

At length, in ſpight of all the Hatred and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of the People, who were round about them, under the Authority of their High-Prieſts, who afterwards became their Kings, they founded the new Kingdom of the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneans,</hi> or the <hi>Mascabees,</hi> more large and extenſive than ever, excepting only th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee in what manner the People of God ſubſiſted always amidſt all this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Changes; and that People who were ſometimes chaſtiſed, and again ſometimes comforted under their Afflictions and Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, by the different Treatments they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived according as they deſerved, bears a ſufficient publick Teſtimony to that Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which governs the World.</p>
               <p>But in what Condition ſoever they were, they lived ſtill in the expectation of the Meſſiah, which was in the fullneſs of time to come, wherein they looked for new Graces, and much greater than any of thoſe they had yet received; and there are none but ſee that this Faith of the Meſſiah, and of his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which continues ſtill to this day among the <hi>Jews,</hi> is deſcended to them from their
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:56382:135"/> Patriarchs and their Prophets, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their Nation.<note place="margin">Joſeph. <hi>1.</hi> cont. Apion.</note> For in that long ſucceſſion of Years, where they themſelves did confeſs that, by a Council of Providence, there was not any other Prophet riſen up among them, and that God made them no new Predictions, nor new Promiſes; this Faith of the Meſſiah which was to come, was more ſprightly, active, and vigorous than ever. It was found ſo firmly eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, when the ſecond Temple was built, that there was no need of a Prophet to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the People in it. They were ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Faith of the antient Prophecies, which they had ſeen ſo exactly fullfilled before their Eyes, in ſo many chief Points: The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eſt, from that time, never was in the leaſt queſtion'd by them, and it was not at all difficult for them to believe that God, who was ſo faithful in every thing, ſhould not alſo accompliſh in its due time that which concern'd the Meſſiah, that is to ſay, the very main of all his Promiſes, and the Ground and Foundation of all the reſt.</p>
               <p>In effect, all their Hiſtory, all that daily happened to them, was but (as it were) one perpetual opening Scene of thoſe Oracles which the Holy Ghoſt had left with them. Being ſo ſettled again in their Land after the Captivity, they enjoyed for three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years a moſt profound Peace; if their Temple was reverenced, and their Religion honoured over all the Eaſt; if at laſt their Peace was ruffled and ſhaken by their Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; if that proud King of <hi>Syria</hi> made unheard of attempts to deſtroy them; if he
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:56382:135"/> ſometime prevailed, if he were a little after puniſhed; if the Jewiſh Religion, and all the People of God were reſtored with a more marvellous glory than ever before, and the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> grew greater to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the end of the time by new Conqueſts: you have ſeen all this was no more than what was found written in their Prophets. Yes, every thing was particularly taken notice of there, even to the time that the Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were to laſt; even to the places where the Battels were to be fought, and even to the Lands which were to be conquered.</p>
               <p>I have in the groſs related ſomething to you of thoſe Prophecies: the Particulars would be matter of a longer Diſcourſe. I will here only give you the firſt Tincture of thoſe important Truths, which is ſo much the more acknowledged as we ſhall enter forward into the Particulars. I ſhall only obſerve here that the Prophecies of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God have had, during all thoſe times,<note place="margin">Porph. de Abſt. lib. <hi>4.</hi> Id. Porphyr. &amp; Jul. apud Cyr. l. <hi>5.</hi> &amp; <hi>6.</hi> in Jul.</note> ſo plain and manifeſt an accompliſhment, that ſince, when the Heathen themſelves, when a <hi>Porphyrius,</hi> when a <hi>Julian</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, otherwiſe Enemies of the Sacred Scriptures, would at any time give Example of Prophetick Predictions, they have been forced to ſeek them among the Jews.</p>
               <p>And I may alſo tell you for a truth, that if during five hundred years the People of God were without a Prophet, all the eſtate of thoſe times was prophetical: The work of God went on, and the ways were preparing inſenſibly for the full accompliſhment of thoſe ancient Oracles.</p>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:56382:136"/>
               <p>The Return from the Captivity of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> was only a ſhadow of the Liberty both more great and more neceſſary, which the Meſſiah was to bring to men that were Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives unto ſin. The People diſperſed in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Aſia,</hi> in <hi>Leſſer Aſia,</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and even in <hi>Greece,</hi> began to make the Name and the Glory of the God of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> ſhine forth more conſpicuouſly among the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The Scriptures, which were one day to be the Light of the World, were put into the moſt known Language of the World: their Antiquity is confeſſed. Whilſt the Temple was had in reverence, and the Scriptures given to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> God ſhews ſome repreſentation to their future Converſion, and lays a great way off the foundations of it.</p>
               <p>What alſo happened among the <hi>Grecians</hi> was a kind of preparation to the knowledge and underſtanding of the Truth. Their Philoſophers confeſſed that the World was governed by a God far different from thoſe whom the common ſort of People worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and whom they alſo ſerved with the common People. The <hi>Greek</hi> Hiſtories be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that this excellent Philoſophy came from the Eaſt, and from thoſe places where the <hi>Jews</hi> had been diſperſed: but from whence ſoever it came, a Truth ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſpread among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> however it was oppoſed, and how ill ſoever it was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, even by thoſe who taught it, began again to awaken Mankind, and by way of anticipation furniſhed them with certain Proofs, who were one day to deliver them from their Ignorance.</p>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:56382:136"/>
               <p>As always the Converſion of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was a work reſerved for the Meſſiah, and the proper Character of his coming, Error and Impiety prevailed every where. The moſt illuminated and wiſeſt Nations, the <hi>Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the <hi>Romans,</hi> were the moſt ignorant and the moſt blind concerning Religion: ſo true is it that we are to be advanced to it by a particular Grace, and by a Wiſdom more than Humane. Who ſhould preſume to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Ceremonies of the Immortal Gods, and their impure Myſteries? their Loves, their Cruelties, their Jealouſies, and all their other Exceſſes were the Subject of their Feaſts, their Sacrifices, and the Hymns which were ſang to them, and of the Pictures which were conſecrated in their Temples. So that wickedneſs was worſhipped, and confeſſed as neceſſary to the Service of the Gods.

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:56382:137"/> they made to their fair Goddeſs. After the defeat of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and his formidable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, there was a Table ſet up in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, where were inſerted their Vows, and their Proceſſions, with this Inſcription of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi> the famous Poet; <hi>Theſe have prayed to the Goddeſs</hi> Venus, <hi>who for their ſakes hath ſaved</hi> Greece.</p>
               <p>If Love be to be adored, it ought at leaſt to be that which is honeſt; but here it was not ſo. <hi>Solon</hi> (who could believe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed who could expect from ſo great a name ſo great a reproach? <hi>Solon,</hi> I ſay) ſet up at <hi>Athens</hi> the Temple of <hi>Venus</hi> the Proſtitute,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> or of illicite Love. All <hi>Greece</hi> was full of Temples Conſecrated to that Deity, and Conjugal Love had not one erected in all the Country.</p>
               <p>But yet they abominated Adultery both in Men and Women: Conjugal Society was held Sacred among them. But when they applyed themſelves to Religion, they ſeemed as if they were poſſeſſed with a ſtrange Spirit, and their Natural Light for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook 'em.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Gravity treated Religion with no more ſeriouſneſs, ſince it conſecrated to the honour of the Gods the Impurities of the Theatre, and the bloody Spectacles of the Gladiators, that is to ſay, whatſoever could be imagined that was moſt corrupt and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous.</p>
               <p>But I know not if the ridiculous Follies which were mingled in their Religion, were not alſo more pernicious to them, for it made them very contemptible. Can any reſpect
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:56382:137"/> which is due to Divine things be kept up, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the Impertinencies of (as we ſay) old Wives Tales, the Repreſentation or Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance whereof makes up ſo great a part of the Divine Worſhip?

               <p>'Tis true, the Philoſophers at laſt were brought to confeſs that there was another God than thoſe which the common People worſhipped; but then they durſt not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly avow it.

                  <hi>Beauties of Holineſs, from the Womb of the Morning;</hi> and the New Teſtament informs us that it was <hi>the Word,</hi> the inward Word of God, and his eternal Thought, who is always in his Boſom, and by whom all things were made.

               </p>
               <p>With the Father and the Son we know alſo the Holy Ghoſt, the Love of both, and their eternal Union. 'Twas that Spirit which made the Prophets, and which was in them to diſcover to them the Councils of God, and the Secrets of Futurity; the Spirit of whom it is written,<note place="margin">Iſai. 48.16.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord God and his Spirit hath ſent me,</hi> which is diſtinguiſhed from the Lord, and which is alſo the Lord himſelf, ſince that he ſent the Prophets, and diſcovered to them things to come. That

               <p>Thus the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghoſt, one ſingle God in three Perſons, ſhewn more darkly to our Fathers, was clearly revealed in the new Covenant.

                  <hi>who was in the Boſom of his Father,</hi> and who without e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver coming from thence, came down to us; to him, I ſay, it belonged fully to diſcover to us thoſe admirable Secrets of the Divine Nature, which <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets had but lightly touched upon.</p>
               <p>It belonged to him to make us underſtand, how it was, that the Meſſiah promiſed as a Man who was to ſave all men, was at the ſame time ſhewn as God in the ſingular Number, and abſolutely after the ſame manner as the Creator himſelf was ſhewn to us; and this is alſo that which he hath done, in teaching us, that though he was the Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 8.58.</note> yet <hi>he was before ever</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>was born,</hi> and that he <hi>came down from Heaven,</hi> and that he always <hi>is in Heaven:</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thus are revealed to us the two great and principal Myſteries, that of the Trinity, and that of the Incarnation. But he who hath revealed them to us, makes us to find the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage thereof in our ſelves, that ſo they might be always preſent to us, and that we might acknowledge the Dignity of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, if we would impoſe Silence on our Senſes, and would for a little while look into our ſelves, into the bottom of our Souls, that is to ſay, into that part where the truth comes to be underſtood, we ſhould find there ſome Image of the Trinity we adore. The thought which we feel to ſpring up as the Bud of our Mind, as the Son of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, gives us ſome Idea of the Son of God eternally conceived in the mind of the heavenly Father. Wherefore that Son of God aſſumes the name of <hi>Word,</hi> to make us underſtand that he ſprang up in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the Father,<note place="margin">Greg. Naz.

               <p>But the fruitfulneſs of our Mind is not terminated on that inward Word, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Thought, that image of Truth which is formed in us. We love both that inward Word, and the Mind in which it ariſes, and in that love we feel ſomewhat in us which we value as highly as our very mind and thought, which is the Fruit of
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:56382:146" rendition="simple:additions"/> both, which unites them; an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So far as there can be found any rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between God and Man; ſo far, I ſay, is produced in God the eternal Love which comes from the Fat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>er who thinks, and from the Son who is his Thought, to make up with him and his Thought one and the ſame nature equally happy and perfect.</p>
               <p>In a word, God is perfect, and his Word the living Image of an infinite Truth, is no leſs perfect than him; and his Love, which, proceeding from the inexhauſtible Fountain of Good, hath all the fulneſs of it, cannot but have an infinite Perfection: And ſince that we have no other Idea of God but that of Perfection, each of thoſe three things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered apart, deſerves to be called God: But beauſe thoſe three things do neceſſarily agree with one and the ſame Nature, thoſe three things therefore make up but one God.</p>
               <p>We ought then to have no unequal nor ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Conceptions of this Adorable Trinity; and how incomprehenſible ſoever the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity be, our Soul, if we will but hearken to it, will tell us ſomething of it.</p>
               <p>It is, and when it knows perfectly what it is, its Intelligence correſponds to the truth of its being:<note place="margin">Aug. loc. citat.</note> And when it loves its being with its underſtanding as much as it deſerves to be belov'd, its Love equals the perfection of both. Thoſe three things are never di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, the one is confined by other, and the third by both: We underſtand that we
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:56382:147"/> are, and that we love, and we love to be, and to underſtand. Who can deny it, if he underſtand himſelf? and not only is not one of thoſe better than another, but three alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether are not better than is one of them by it ſelf, ſince that each of them do bind the whole, do conclude the whole, and that in thoſe three conſiſts the Felicity and Dignity of the reaſonable Nature. Thus is the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which we worſhip, and to which we are conſecrated by our Baptiſm; thus, I ſay, and infinitely more is it perfect, unſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, one in its Eſſence, and in ſhort, equal in every ſence.</p>
               <p>But we our ſelves, who are the Image of the Trinity, we, in another reſpect, are alſo the Image of the Incarnation.</p>
               <p>A Soul of a ſpiritual and incorruptible Nature, hath a corruptible Body which is united to it:<note place="margin">Aug.

Theſe Attributes agree with the whole, by relation to each of its two parts; So the divine Word, whoſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue ſuſtains the whole, by relation to each of its two parts; ſo the divine Word, whoſe Virtue ſuſtains the whole, is united in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner, or rather it becomes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by a perfect Union, that Jeſus Chriſt the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> that which makes him to be the Son of God and Man both together, begotten from all Eternity, and yet begotten in time, always living in the Boſom of his Father, and yet dead upon the Croſs for our Salvation.</p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:56382:147"/>
               <p>But where God finds himſelf mixed, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons drawn from humane things are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver but imperfect. Our Soul is not before our Body, and ſomething fails it when ever it is ſeparated from it. The Word perfect in it ſelf from all Eternity, is only united to our Nature for its Honour. That Soul which preſides over the Body, and makes ſeveral Changes in it, it ſelf ſuffers from it in its turn. If the Body be moved at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and according to the Will of the Soul, the Soul is troubled, the Soul is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and influenced a thouſand ways, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tormenting or pleaſing, according to the Diſpoſitions of the Body; ſo that as the Soul raiſes up the Body to it ſelf in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part, ſo it is caſt down below it by what it ſuffers from the Body. But in Jeſus Chriſt, the word preſides over all, it keeps all under its Dominion. So Man is raiſed, and the Word is not caſt down by any thing: Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable and unalterable it rules and governs Nature which is united to it in all things throughout.</p>
               <p>From thence it comes, that in Jeſus Chriſt, Man, abſolutely ſubmiſſive to the inward direction of the Word which raiſes it up to it ſelf, has only divine Thoughts and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. All that he thinks, all that he wills, all that he ſays, all that he conceals within, all that he ſhews outwardly, is animated and inſpired by the Word, led by the Word, worthy of Word, that is to ſay, worthy of Reaſon it ſelf, of Wiſdom it ſelf, and of Truth it ſelf. Wherefore every thing is Light in Jeſus Chriſt: His Conduct is a Rule;
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:56382:148"/> his Miracles are Inſtructions, his Words are Spirit and Life.</p>
               <p>It is not given to all to underſtand theſe ſublime Truths, nor perfectly to ſee in himſelf that marvellous Image of divine things, which St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and the other Fathers have thought ſo certain. Our Senſes govern us too much, and our Imagination which will be concerned in all our Thoughts, does not ſuffer us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to ſtay upon ſo pure a Light. We do not know our ſelves; we are ignorant what vaſt Riches we conſtantly carry about with us, becauſe we ſearch not to the bottom of our Natures; and only the moſt inwardly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Eyes can perceive them. But as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle as we do pry into that Secret, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in our ſelves the Image of the two My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, which make up the Foundation of our Faith, that is ſufficient to raiſe us up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, and nothing of Mortality can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect us any more.</p>
               <p>Alſo Jeſus Chriſt calls us to an immortal Glory, and it is the Fruit of the Faith we have for the Myſteries.</p>
               <p>That God-Man, that incarnate Truth and Wiſdom, which makes us to believe ſuch great things upon its ſingle Authority, promiſes to us the clear and happy Viſion of it in Eternity, as the certain Recompence of our Faith.</p>
               <p>In this way, is the Miſſion of Jeſus Chriſt infinitely advanced above that of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſent to rouſe up ſenſual and brutiſh Men by temporal Rewards. Since that they were become all Body and all Fleſh, it was neceſſary for him at firſt to captivate
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:56382:148"/> them by their Senſes, and by that means to inculcate into them the Knowledg of God, and the horror of Idolatry, to which Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind had ſo prodigious an Inclination.</p>
               <p>That was the Miniſtry of <hi>Moſes:</hi> But to inſpire Man with more exalted Thoughts, and by a full Evidence to convince him of the Dignity, Immortality, and eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of his Soul, this was reſerv'd to be the Work of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In the times of Ignorance, that is to ſay, thoſe which were before our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours days, what the Soul knew of its Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Immortality, led it for the moſt part to Error. The worſhipping of dead Men did almoſt make up all their Idolatry: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all Men ſacrificed to the <hi>Manes,</hi> that is, to the Souls of the Dead. Thoſe antient Errors do diſcover to us indeed how great was the antient Belief of the Souls Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and ſhows us that we ought to place it among the firſt Traditions of Mankind. But Man who ſpoil'd all things, had ſtrangely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed it, ſince the Soul carried him out to ſacrifice to the Dead. Nay they went at laſt to that exceſs, as to ſacrifice living Men to them; they killed their Slaves, and even their Women, to make them go and ſerve them in the other World. The <hi>Gauls</hi> did ſo with many other People: And the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> obſerved by the Heathen Authors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the firſt Defenders of the Souls Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality;<note place="margin">Caſ. de hell.

                  </note> have alſo been the firſt Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of thoſe abominable Murders in the World, under the pretence of Religion. The ſame <hi>Indians</hi> uſed to kill themſelves to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:56382:149" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Happineſs of the future Life; and that deplorable Blindneſs continues ſtill to this day among thoſe People; ſo dangerous is it to teach the Truth in any other way or manner than what God hath inſtituted, and clearly to explain to Man all that he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he knew God perfectly.</p>
               <p>'Twas the want of knowing God, which made moſt of the Philoſophers not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Immortality of the Soul, without believing it at the ſame time a Portion of the Divinity, nay a Divinity it ſelf, an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Being, uncreated as well as incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and which had neither beginning not end. What ſhall I ſay of thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Tranſmigration of Souls; who made them skip from Heaven to Earth, and then from Earth to Heaven again; from Beaſts into Men, and from Men into Beaſts; from Happineſs to Miſery, and from Miſery to Happineſs; and thoſe Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions never to have any end, nor any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain order? How ſadly was the Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Providence, and Goodneſs, darkened amidſt ſo many fuliginous Errors! And how neceſſary was it to know God, and the Rules of his Wiſdom, before he knows the Soul, and its immortal Nature!</p>
               <p>Wherefore the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> gave only to Man the firſt Notion of the nature of the Soul, and its Felicity. We ſaw the Soul at firſt made by the Power of God, as well as the reſt of the Creatures; but with this particular Character and Diſtinction, that it was made after his Image, and by his Breath; that it might underſtand to whom
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:56382:149"/> it was obliged by its being, and alſo that it might never fancy it ſelf to be of the ſame nature with the Body, not formed by its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and concurrence. But the Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this Doctrine, and the Marvels of the future Life, were not then univerſally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded; This great Light and Diſcovery was not to be till the coming of the Meſſiah.</p>
               <p>God had ſcattered ſome few Sparks of it in the Old Teſtament. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid, that <hi>the Duſt ſhould return to the Earth as it was;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.7.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Spirit ſhall return to God who gave it.</hi> The Patriarchs, and the Prophets lived in that Hope, and <hi>Daniel</hi> had foretold that there ſhould a time come,<note place="margin">Dan. 12.1, 2, 4.</note> that <hi>thoſe who ſlept in the Duſt of the Earth, ſhould awake; ſome to everlarting Life; and ſome to ſhame and everlaſting Contempt.</hi> But at the ſame time that thoſe things were revealed to him, he was commanded to <hi>ſeal up the Book, even to the time of the End,</hi> to let us underſtand that the full diſcovery of theſe Truths was reſerved for another Seaſon, and another Age.</p>
               <p>But though the <hi>Jews</hi> had in their Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſome Promiſes of eternal Happineſs, and that towards the time of the Meſſiah's coming, in which they were to be declared, they ſpoke much more of them, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Books of Wiſdom, and the <hi>Maccabees;</hi> yet however, this Truth gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo little Reputation among the antient People, that the <hi>Saducees,</hi> without ever know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, not only were admitted into the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, but alſo were advanced to the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. It was one of the Characters of the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:56382:150"/> new People, to lay down as a Foundation of Religion, the faith of a future Life, and that was to be the Fruit of the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi>

                  </gap>eſſary that <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> ſhould propoſe to us new Ideas of Vertue; more perfect and purified Practices. The End of Religion, the Soul of Vertues, and the Abridgment of the Law, is Charity. But until <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was come into the World, we may ſay, that the perfection, and the effects of that Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue were not throughly known. It was truly and properly our bleſſed Saviour that taught us to place our Satisfaction in God alone. To ſet up the Kingdom of Charity, and to reveal to us all the Duties of it, he lays be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us the Love of God, even to the hating of our ſelves, and continually perſecuting that Principle of Corruption which we all carry about with us in our hearts. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds to us the Love of our Neighbour, even to the extending that beneficent Inclination to all men, including therein even thoſe that hate and perſecute us: he propoſes to us the moderating of our ſenſual Deſires, even to the abſolute cutting off our own Members, that is to ſay, that which gives us the moſt lively and ſenſible impreſſions: He propoſes alſo to us ſubmiſſion to the Will of God, even to the rejoycing at the Sufferings he lays up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us; as alſo Humility, and that too to the loving of Reproaches for God's ſake, and to the believing that no Indignities, how inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſoever, can make us ſo vile in the eyes of men, as we truly are in God's ſight by our ſhameful and abominable ſins. Upon this foundation of Charity it is, that all the conditions of Humane Life are perfected. It is by that, that Marriage is reduced to its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:56382:151" rendition="simple:additions"/> form: the Conjugal Affection is now no more divided; ſo holy a Society is only terminated by Death; and Children do not now ſee their Mothers caſt out for enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of a Step-dame in their places. Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libacy is ſet forth as an Imitation of the life of Angels, which is wholly and entirely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with God, and with the chaſt delights of his Love. Superiours do learn that they are the Servants of others, and devoted to their Good; and Inferiours do acknowledge the wiſe order of God in their lawful Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, although they abuſe their Authority: this very thought ſweetens to us the hardſhips of Subjection, and <hi>under the moſt trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Maſters Obedience is not at all trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to the true Christian.</hi>

               <p>To theſe Precepts he ſuperadds Councils of eminent perfection; to renounce all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; to live in the Body as if we with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Body; to forſake all things; to give all we have to the Poor, that we may poſſeſs nothing but God; to live upon a little, yea almoſt upon nothing; and to expect that little too from Divine Providence.</p>
               <p>But that Law which is moſt proper to the Goſpel, is that of bearing his Croſs. The Croſs is the true Trial of Faith, the true Foundation of Hope, the perfect purifier of Charity; in a word, the true way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> dyed on the Croſs; he bore his Croſs all the while he lived; 'tis by the Croſs that he would have us to follow him, and he hath promiſed to reward it with Eternal Life. The firſt to whom he parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly made this Promiſe of Everlaſting
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:56382:151" rendition="simple:additions"/> Reſt, was a Companion of his Croſs: <hi>This day,</hi> ſaith he,<note place="margin">Luke 22.48.</note> 
                  <hi>thou ſhalt be with me in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</hi> Immediately after his Expiration on the Croſs, the Veil which covered the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary was rent from the top to the bottom, and the Heaven was opened to holy Souls. It was after he came from the Croſs, and from the horrours of his Puniſhment, that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to his Apoſtles, glorious, and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour over Death, that they might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by learn and underſtand that it was by the Croſs they were to enter into his Glory, and that he would ſhew no other way to his Children.</p>
               <p>Thus in the Perſon of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was given to the World the lively Image of an accompliſhed Vertue, who had nothing, nor did expect nothing here in this World; who received from men only continual Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet he never ceaſed doing of them good, and for all that on whom his very kindneſſes brought the worſt of puniſhments. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> dyed without finding any Gratitude in thoſe whom he obliged, nor Fidelity from his Friends, nor Equity in his Judges. His Innocence, although it was acknowledged, did not ſave him; his Father himſelf, in whom alone he had put his truſt and hope, withdrew all the Marks of his Protection: the Juſt is delivered up to his Enemies, and he dyed forſaken both of God and Men.</p>
               <p>But every good and holy man will ſee, that in thoſe his greateſt Extremities, he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtood in need of any Humane Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor even any viſible and ſenſible Sign of the Divine Succour: for it was God
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:56382:152"/> he only loved, and in whom he only truſted, and he was ſure that He thought on him, though there were not any outward ſigns of it, and that an everlaſting Happineſs was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Soc. apud Plat. Dial. <hi>11.</hi> de Rep.</note>The wiſeſt of the Philoſophers, in his reſearches after an Idea of Vertue, found out, that as of all wicked men, he would be the moſt flagitious, who knew how moſt artificially to hide his Malice, that he might be taken for a good man, and by that means enjoy all the credit that Vertue was able to give him: ſo the moſt vertuous man without doubt was he, whoſe perfective Vertue gained him the envy and jealouſie of all men, ſo that he had only the integrity of his own unreproveable Conſcience on his ſide, though he ſaw himſelf expoſed to all manner of Injuries, even to be nailed on the Croſs, his Vertue not being able to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford him that poor Succour of freeing him from ſuch a Puniſhment. Certainly God did put this marvellous Idea of Vertue in the mind of a Philoſopher, to render it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in the Perſon of his Son, and to ſhew that the Juſt man had another Glory, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Repoſe, and in a word another Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than he could have here upon Earth.</p>
               <p>To make clear this truth, and to ſhew it fulfilled ſo viſibly in himſelf at the expence of his own Life, was the greateſt work that a man could do; and God found it ſo great, that he reſerved it for this ſo much promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> for this Man whom he made the ſame Perſon with his only Son.</p>
               <p>Indeed what greater thing could be reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:56382:152"/> for a God that was to come down upon the Earth? and what could he do here more worthy of himſelf, than to ſhew Vertue in all its purity, and the eternal Happineſs to which we are led by thoſe Sufferings which this World looks on as the moſt grievous and reproachful?</p>
               <p>But if we will conſider what yet there was of a higher and more perfective Excellency in the Myſtery of the Croſs, what Human Underſtanding can fathom it? There are diſcovered to us ſuch Vertues as none but the <hi>God-Man</hi> could practiſe. Who elſe could, like him, put himſelf in the ſtead of all the old Sacrifices, and aboliſh them in ſubſtituting to them a Victime of infinite Dignity and Merit, and to order for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that none beſides himſelf ſhould be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up to God? ſuch was the act of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> performed on the Croſs. The Eternal Father, could he find either among Men, or Angels, an Obedience equal to that which his Well-beloved Son paid him, as when nothing was able to take his Life out of his hands, he voluntarily laid it down to pleaſe him? What ſhall I ſay of the perfect Union of all his Deſires with the Divine Will, and of the Love whereby <hi>God was in him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.19.</note> 
                  <hi>reconciling the World unto himſelf.</hi> In that incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Union he embraced all Mankind, he pacified Heaven and Earth, he plunged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with an immenſe ardour into that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge of Blood <hi>with which he was to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized</hi> with all his faithful Followers,<note place="margin">Luke 12.50.</note> and he made to come out of his Wounds the <hi>fire</hi> of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:56382:153"/> Divine Love <hi>which was to burn up all the Earth.</hi> But that which paſſes all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is, to behold the Juſtice uſed by that <hi>God-Man,</hi> who was ſuffered to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the World, to the end that the World might remain eternally condemned through the enormous Iniquity of that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.<note place="margin">John 12.31.</note>

But a greater Triumph yet was laid before our Eyes; the Divine Juſtice was it ſelf van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed; the Sinner, who was due to it as its Victime, was ſnatch'd out of its hands. He found a Surety was able to pay for him an infinite price. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was eternally united to the Elect for whom he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:56382:153"/> they became his Members and his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: the Eternal Father could no longer look upon them but in him their Head: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he likewiſe extended towards them the infinite Love which he had for his Son. 'Twas this Son himſelf that begged it of him: he would not be ſeparated from thoſe men whom he had bought and redeemed with his moſt precious Blood. <hi>Father, I will, that they alſo whom thou haſt given me,</hi>

               <p>After ſo great a Benefit, what can there be more than Cryes of Joy and Thanks whereby to be able to expreſs our Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments? <hi>O miracles,</hi>

The iniquity of many is hid in one juſt One, and the juſtice of One alone makes it that many are juſtified.</hi> What then are we not to pretend to? <hi>God commendeth has love towards us,</hi>

                  <hi>in that, while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt dyed for us.

               <p>Whilſt <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was filling up our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and ſurpaſſing our hopes, he finiſhed the work of God which was begun under the Patriarchs, and in the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then God reſolved to make himſelf known by ſenſible Experiences: he ſhewed himſelf very magnificent in Temporal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, good in heaping upon his Children ſuch Bleſſings as flattered the Senſes, powerful in delivering them from the hands of their Enemies, faithful in leading them into the Land of Promiſe to their Fathers, juſt by the Rewards and Puniſhments which he openly ſent them according to their works.</p>
               <p>All his marvellous Works prepared the way for the Truths which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> came to teach. If God be ſo good as to beſtow on us what is agreeable to our Senſes, how much rather ſhall he give unto us what is agreeable to our Souls which were made after his own Image? If he be ſo tender and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:56382:154"/> towards his Children, ſhall he ſhut up his love and his bounty in thoſe few years which make up our life? Will he give to thoſe whom he loves only a ſhadow of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, a fertile Land in Corn and Oyl? Will there not be a heavenly Country wherein he will abundantly recompence us with true and everlaſting good things?</p>
               <p>There will be one without all peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> will come to ſhew it us. For indeed the Almighty would do works very unworthy of himſelf, if all his magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence ſhould terminate in Grandeurs that were only expoſed to our weak and infirm Senſes. Whatſoever is not eternal, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther correſpondent to the Majeſty of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal God, nor does it anſwer the hopes of man, to whom he hath made known his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; and that unchangeable fidelity which he bears to his Servants will never have an Object proportionable to it, until it be extended to ſomething that is immortally permanent.</p>
               <p>Therefore will <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> at laſt come and open the Heavens to us, to diſocover there to our Faith <hi>that abiding City,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11.8.9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>which hath Foundations, whoſe Builder and Maker is God,</hi> where we are to be gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after this life. He ſhews us, that if God make <hi>Eternal</hi> to be one of his Titles, the Name of the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and of <hi>Jacob,</hi> it is becauſe thoſe holy men are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways living before him.<note place="margin">Matth. 22.32.

                  <hi>Egypt,</hi> from whence we were to come out, the Wilderneſs through which we were to paſs, <hi>Babylon,</hi> whoſe Priſon-walls we were to break to enter, or to return into our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that was this World with all its delights and vanities; for here it was that we were truly Captives, and Pilgrims, led aſtray by Sin, and Concupiſcence; we were to ſhake off this Yoke to find in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and in the City of our God true liberty, and <hi>an Houſe</hi> or <hi>Sanctuary not made with hands,</hi>

               <p>By this Doctrine of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery</hi> of God was laid open to us, the Law was all Spiritual, its Promiſes were introductive of thoſe of the Goſpel, and ſerved as a Foundation to them.

               <p>To this Chriſt, to this God-Man, to this Man who held upon Earth, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks, the place of The Truth, and diſcovers it to be perſonally reſident amongſt us; to him, I ſay, it was reſerved to ſhew us all Truth, that is to ſay, ſo much of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, of the Vertues, and of the Rewards, as God had deſigned for thoſe whom he real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loved.</p>
               <p>Theſe were the Grandeurs which the <hi>Jews</hi> ought to have look'd for in their <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> There is nothing ſo great and glorious, as to carry in it ſelf, and to diſcover unto men Truth in its fulneſs and perfection, which ſeeds them and directs them, and clears up their eyes ſo as to make 'em capable of ſeeing God.</p>
               <p>Now in this time when the Truth was to be diſcovered to men with that fulneſs, it was alſo commanded to be promulged throughout all the Earth, and at all times.

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:56382:157"/> could no longer endure any legitimate Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and ſo they were unlimited in their attempts. God gave them up to a reprobate Sence.

                  </note> They were cut off with all the marks of the Divine Vengeance: driven out of their own Land, and made Slaves to all the World; they no longer had either Temple, or Altar, or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, or Country; and there was ſeen in <hi>Judah</hi> not ſo much as a form of People.</p>
               <p>But God had notwithſtanding provided for the Eternity of his Government: The Eyes of the Gentiles were opened, and they were united in Spirit to the converted <hi>Jews.</hi> By that means they were joined to the Race and Stock of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and became his Children by Faith, and ſo inherited the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes which had been made to him. A new People were formed, and the new Sacrifice ſo much celebrated by the Prophets, began to be offered throughout all the World.</p>
               <p>Thus was that antient Oracle or <hi>Jacob</hi> fulfilled to a tittle: <hi>Judah</hi> from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was multiplied more than all his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; and having always kept a certain Preheminence, he at laſt received the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as Hereditary to him.

               <p>But to keep the Succeſſion and the Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity, it was neceſſary to have this new peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple engrafted, as I may ſo ſay, upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>if thou being a wild Olive tree were grafted in amongſt then,</hi>

               <p>Thus that laſt and dreadful deſolation of the <hi>Jews</hi> was no more a tranſmigration, like that of <hi>Babylon;</hi> it was not a ſuſpenſion of the Government, and of the Eſtate of the People of God, nor of the ſolemn ſervice of Religion, the new People already form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and continued with the old in Jeſus Chriſt, were not tranſported; they extended and ſpread themſelves without interruption from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where they were firſt to ariſe, even to the utmoſt parts of the Earth.

               <p>After the Eſtabliſhment of that new King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, it is not to be wondered at, if all things went to wrack in <hi>Judea.</hi> The ſecond Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſignified no longer any thing, ſince that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> had fulfilled in it what was foretold by the Prophets.

               <p>A Myſtery ſo marvellous and ſo advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to the inſtruction of Mankind, deſerves very well to be conſidered.

               <p>After he had ſpoken of the ſmall number of the <hi>Jews</hi> who had received the Goſpel, and of the blindneſs of the reſt, he falls into a profound conſideration to think what that People ought to be who were honoured with ſo many favours, and at laſt he diſcovers to us the benefit we ſhould reap by their fall, and the fruits which their Converſion ſhould one day produce. <hi>The Jews, have they ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that they ſhould fall?</hi>

This great Apoſtle hath diſcovered to us the Grace which goes from one People to another to keep them all in fear leſt they ſhould loſe it; and hath alſo manifeſted its invincible force and power, in that after it had converted I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters, it ſhould reſerve it ſelf for its laſt work, the convincing the <hi>Jews</hi> of their hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and contumacious perfidiouſneſs.</p>
               <p>By this profound Counſel of God the <hi>Jews</hi> remain ſtill among all Nations, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were diſperſed and carried captive: but they remain likewiſe with the branded Character of their Reprobation, being vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly fallen by their Infidelity of the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which were made to their Fathers, baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Land of Promiſe, having not any Land to cultivate, but are Slaves in all

               <p>But the Miracle of Miracles, if I may ſo ſpeak, is this, that with the belief of the Myſteries, the moſt eminent Vertues, and the moſt difficult and painful Practices were exerciſed almoſt all the World over. The Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> followed him in his moſt rugged ways. To ſuffer all for the Truth, was a common thing with his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and to be Imitators of their dear and bleſſed Saviour, they ran to their Torments with more zeal and eagerneſs than others did to their greateſt Pleaſures and Delights. Innumerable are the Examples of the Rich, who have in a manner beggered themſelves to ſupply the Neceſſities of the Poor; and ſo likewiſe of the Poor who have preferred penury and want to Riches; of Virgins who have here upon Earth imitated the life of Angels; and of the charitable Paſtors and Shepherds who became all things to all men, and always were ready to give to their Flock not only their Vigils and their Labours, but to lay down their very Lives for their ſakes. What ſhall I ſay concerning Repentance and Mortification? the very Judges never executed their Sentences more ſeverely upon Criminals, than the penitent Sinners have inflicted Puniſhments on their own ſelves. Nay more, the moſt Innoc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nt have with an
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:56382:164"/> incredible Severity puniſhed in themſelves that prodigious inclination which is in us all to ſin. The life of St. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> which ſeemed ſo much to aſtoniſh the Jews, was u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual among the Faithful: Deſarts have been populated with his Imitators: and there were in thoſe days ſo many that ſought out places of Retirement, that the moſt perfect of them have been forced to find out Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats of a more profound Solitude to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Auſterities of their Piety and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; ſo much did they ſhun the World, and ſo delightful was the life of Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them.</p>
               <p>Theſe were the precious Fruits the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel was to be productive of. The Church abounded no leſs in Examples than in her Precepts, and her Doctrine appeared holy, by the infinite Number of her Saints. God Almighty, who knew that the moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and eminent Vertues would ariſe from Sufferings, founded her by Martyrdom, and kept her for three hundred years in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, without giving her one moments quiet or repoſe. After that he had by ſo long an Experience fully ſhewn that he ſtood in no need of any Humane Succour, nor of the Powers upon Earth to eſtabliſh his Church, he then called Emperours into it, and made of the Great <hi>Conſtantine</hi> a declared Protector of Chriſtianity. From that time Kings have run from all parts into the Church; and all that was writ in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies concerning its future glory, has been accompliſhed in the ſight of all the Earth.</p>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:56382:164"/>
               <p>And if ſhe hath been Invincible againſt the Efforts without, ſhe hath been no leſs ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all inteſtine Diviſions. Thoſe Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies ſo often foretold by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles, have come to paſs, and the Faith that was perſecuted by the Emperours, did at the ſame time ſuffer a more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Perſecution from the Hereticks. But that Perſecution was never more violent than in the time that the Heathen Perſecution was ſeen to ceaſe. Then Hell made its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Efforts to deſtroy by it ſelf that Church which the Aſſaults of its declared Enemies had ſtrengthened and confirmed. Scarce did ſhe begin to reſpire by the Peace which <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> gave her, but behold <hi>Arrius,</hi> that unhappy Prieſt, raiſed her up greater Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles than ever ſhe had ſuffered before. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius</hi> the Son of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> ſeduced by the <hi>Arrians,</hi> whoſe <hi>Dogmata</hi> he authorized, tormented the Catholicks on all ſides, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a new Perſecutor of Chriſtianity, and was ſo much the more formidable, as that under the Name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> he made war with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf. For the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of all her Miſeries, the Church thus divided falls into the hands of <hi>Julian</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate, who laboured all he could to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Chriſtianity, and found no better way than to foment Factions wherewith it was torn. To him ſucceeded a <hi>Valens</hi> as much an <hi>Arrian</hi> as <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> but more violent. Other Emperours protected other Hereſies with as equal heat and fury. The Church learnt by all theſe Experiences, that ſhe was likely to ſuffer no leſs under Chriſtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:56382:165"/> than ſhe had done under thoſe that were Infidel, and that ſhe was to ſhed her Blood not only for the defence of all the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of her Doctrine, but of every particular Article of it. Indeed, there was not any but what ſhe ſaw aſſaulted by her own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. A thouſand Sects and Hereſies that had come out of her Boſom were riſen up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her. But if, according as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had foretold, ſhe ſaw them riſe againſt her, ſhe likewiſe ſaw them fall before her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Promiſes, though they were oft-times ſupported by Emperours and Kings. Her true Sons, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, were known by this proof; Truth, the more it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, was thereby ſo much the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and the Church remained, like the Building whoſe Foundation was on a Rock, unſhaken.</p>

                  </gap>t I may not leave you in a loſs of ſuch great and important matters.</p>
               <p>And firſt, I would beg of your Highneſs to conſider with a more particular attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the fall of the <hi>Jews,</hi> all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances whereof bear Teſtimony to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Thoſe Circumſtances are unfolded to us by Infidel Authors, by <hi>Jews,</hi> and by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, who without underſtanding the courſe
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:56382:165"/> of the Councells and Decrees of God, have reported to us the weighty matters of Fact, by which he was pleaſed to declare it.</p>
               <p>We have <hi>Joſephus,</hi> a Jewiſh Author, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faithful Hiſtorian, and well verſed in the affairs of his Nation, the Antiquities of which, he hath illuſtrated by an admirable Work. He hath written the laſt War, whereby it was deſtroyed, after he had been preſent at all, and had himſelf ſerved his Country in it with a very conſiderable Command.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> do alſo furniſh us with other very antient Authors, whoſe Teſtimonies you will ſee. They have antient Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries upon the Books of the Scripture, and among others, the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſes which they Print with their Bibles. They have their Book called the <hi>Talmud,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which they have as high a reverence for, as for the Scripture it ſelf. 'Tis a Collection of the Treatiſes and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of their antient Maſters; and tho' the parts whereof that great work is compoſed, be not all of the ſame antiquity, yet the laſt Authors who are cited there, lived in the firſt Ages of the Church. There, among a multitude of impertinent Stories which ſeem for the moſt part to begin after the time of our Bleſſed Saviour, we find very fair remains of the antient Traditions of the Jewiſh People, and Proofs ſufficient to convince them.</p>
               <p>And firſt of all it is certain by the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Jews themſelves, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Vengeance was never more terribly, nor

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> which came pretty near to the time of the Death of Jeſus Chriſt, there were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſeen in the Temple ſtrange things. Every day ſome new Prodigies appeared there,<note place="margin">R. Johan. <hi>the Son of</hi> Zachai.

               </p>
               <p>What was more obſervable than that frightful noiſe which was heard by the Prieſts in the Sanctuary, on the day of Pentecoſt, and that audible voice that came from the inmoſt part of that ſacred place, which ſaid, <hi>Let us depart hence, let us depart hence?</hi> The Holy Angels which were the Protectors of the Temple did loudly declare that they were leaving it, becauſe that God, who had made his abode in it for ſo many Ages, had then reprobated it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joſephus</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> have alſo recounted that Prodigy to us. It was only perceived by the Prieſts. But there was another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy which ſtartled the Eyes of all People; and never had any other People ſeen the like before.<note place="margin">Joſeph lib. <hi>6.</hi> de bel.

                  <hi>Four years before the War was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, a Countryman,</hi> ſays Joſephus, <hi>cryed out, A voice is gone out from the</hi> Eaſt, <hi>a voice is gone out from the</hi> Weſt, <hi>a voice is gone on from the four Winds; a voice againſt</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem <hi>and the Temple; a voice againſt Men and Women that are newly Married: a voice againſt
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:56382:166"/> all this People.</hi> And from that time neither Night nor Day did he leave crying, <hi>Wo, Wo to Jeruſalem.</hi> He redoubled his Cries on Feaſt-days. Not any other word was heard to come out of his Mouth: Thoſe who complained of him, thoſe who curſed him, thoſe who gave him meat, never heard any thing elſe come from him, beſide that terrible voice, <hi>Wo, wo to Jeruſalem.</hi> He was taken, interrogated, and condemned to be ſcourged by the Magiſtrates; to every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and at every blow, he anſwered, without complaining, <hi>Wo to Jeruſalem.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing let go as a Madman, he run up and down all the Country, continually repeating that heavy Prophecy. And ſo he held on cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſeven years, and his voice never wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hoarſe nor weary. Till at the time of the laſt Siege of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he ſhut himſelf up in the City, and upon the Walls there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with a loud Voice, he unceſſantly cried out, <hi>Woe, Woe to the City, woe to the Temple, woe to all the People;</hi> and laſtly he added, <hi>Woe alſo to my ſelf,</hi> which words were no ſooner uttered, but a Stone ſlung out of an Engine, carried him away.</p>
               <p>Might not one almoſt ſay, may it pleaſe your Highneſs, that the divine Vengeance became viſible in that Man, who only ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted to pronounce its Decrees, that it had filled him with its Power, that ſo he might equal the Calamities of the People by his Cries; and that at laſt he ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by an effect of that Vengeance, which he had for ſo long a time before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, to make it thereby the more ſenſible
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:56382:167"/> and the more preſent, when he was to be not only the Prophet and the witneſs of it, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to fall a Sacrifice to it.</p>
               <p>That Prophet of the woes of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was called <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and was the Son of <hi>Anan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Let us ſearch a little farther into the Judgments of God, under the Conduct of the Scriptures. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Temple thereof were twice deſtroyed; once by <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzer,</hi> and the other time by <hi>Titu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</hi> But in each of thoſe times, the Juſtice of God was made manifeſt by the ſame ways, though it was more conſpicuous in the latter.</p>
               <p>For the better underſtanding the order of the Councells of God, let us firſt lay down this Truth ſo often eſtabliſhed in the ſacred Oracles; that one of the moſt terrible ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Divine Vengeance, is when in the Puniſhment of our precedent Sins, it deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers us up to a reprobate Mind, ſo as that we are deaf to all wiſe and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="321" facs="tcp:56382:167"/> without ever meaſuring our own Strength with that of our Enemies whom we provoke.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and its Princes were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the firſt time under the hand of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Weak, and always beaten by that victorious King, they often found they made but vain Efforts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and were obliged to ſwear Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to him.

               <p>With theſe Marks the <hi>Jews</hi> confeſſed that the Hand of God was upon them. But that the divine Vengeance might be as plain and manifeſt to them in the laſt Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as it had been in the former, there was ſeen in them both, the ſame Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, the ſame Temerity, and the ſame Hardneſs and Obduracy.</p>

Nay more, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was taken; the Fire was already blaſing on all ſides: And yet thoſe mad People ſtill believed their falſe Prophets who aſſured them that the Day of Salvation was come, that ſo they might ſtill reſiſt, and there be no hopes of Mercy left for them. In fine, they were all maſſacred, the City was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly overthrown, and ſaving ſome Remains of Towers which <hi>Titus</hi> reſerved to ſerve as a Monument to Poſterity, there was not one Stone left upon another.</p>
               <p>Your Highneſs ſees then that the ſame Vengeance broke out now upon <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as did befal it under <hi>Zedekiah.

                  </hi> burnt down to the Ground. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all the Prohibitions of <hi>Titus</hi> openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> and notwithſtanding the natural Inclination of the Souldiers to pillage rather than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume ſo much Wealth and Riches, a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier <hi>moved,</hi> as <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſays, <hi>with ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Fury,</hi> was lifted up by his Fellows to a Window with a flaming Firebrand in his Hand, and caſt it into the golden Gate, and ſo preſently ſet fire on the Temple. <hi>Titus</hi> at the News hereof runs in haſt, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:56382:169"/> his Souldiers to quench the growing Flames, but it took hold of all in an Inſtant, and ſo that admirable Building was burnt to Aſhes.</p>
               <p>Now if the <hi>Jews</hi> hardneſs of Heart under King <hi>Zedekiah</hi> was the moſt terrible effect, and the moſt ſure Sign of the Divine Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, what ſhall we ſay of the Blindneſs which was ſo apparent in the time of <hi>Titus?</hi> In the firſt Ruine of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> did take part, and joined one with another: in the latter, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> being beſieged by the <hi>Romans</hi> was torn to pieces by three Factions, Enemies. If the Hatred they all had againſt the <hi>Romans</hi> went out even to Fury; they were no leſs bloudy and cruel againſt one another; the Battles without were leſs expenſive of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Blood than thoſe that were within: Preſently after the Aſſaults maintained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Stranger, the Citizens fell together by the Ears among themſelves. Violence and Thievery was every where prevailing in the City. It was deſtroyed, and became but an open Field of dead Bodies, and the Chiefs of the ſeveral Factions diſputed only for the Empire of it. Was not this a Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Hell, where the Damned do no leſs hate one another than they hate the Devils that are their common Enemies, and where every place is full of Pride, Confuſion, and Rage?</p>
               <p>Your Highneſs muſt confeſs then that the Juſtice which God brought on the <hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was but a Shadow of that whereof <hi>Titus</hi> was the Miniſter. What City ever ſaw deſtroyed eleven hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:56382:170"/> Men in ſeven Months time, and in one only Siege? And yet this the <hi>Jews</hi> beheld in the laſt Siege of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The <hi>Chaldeans</hi> had never made them ſuffer the like: Their Captivity under the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> laſted but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty Years; but it is ſixteen hundred Years ſince they were made Slaves all over the World, and as yet they do not find any mitigation of their Slavery.</p>
               <p>It is not to be wondered at, if Victorious <hi>Titus,</hi> after the taking of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> would not receive the Congratulations of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring People, nor the Crowns which they ſent him in honour of his Conqueſt. So many memorable Circumſtances, the Wrath of God, which was ſo manifeſt, and his Hand which he then ſaw was preſent, kept him in a profound Aſtoniſhment, and that made him ſay what you have already heard, that he was not the Conqueror, he was only a weak Inſtrument of the Divine Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.</p>
               <p>But he knew not all the Myſterie of it: The Hour was not yet come that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors were to confeſs <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It was the time of the Humiliations and Perſecutions of the Church. Wherefore <hi>Titus,</hi> tho' he was illuminated enough to underſtand that <hi>Juda</hi> was deſtroyed by a manifeſt effect of God's Juſtice, yet he did not know what the Crime was that made God reſolved ſo terribly to puniſh her. But it was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all Crimes, a Crime till then unheard of, that is to ſay the <hi>Deicide,</hi> which alſo brought down ſuch a Vengeance as never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World had ſeen any Example of.</p>
               <pb n="327" facs="tcp:56382:170"/>
               <p>But if we will a little open our eyes, and conſider the courſe of things, we ſhall ſee that neither that Sin of the <hi>Jews,</hi> nor their Puniſhment, could be concealed from us.</p>
               <p>Let us remember only what <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had foretold them. He had propheſied the abſolute deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and of the Temple: when he ſaid,<note place="margin">Matth. 24.1, 2. Mark 13.1, 2. Luke 21.5, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, there ſhall not be left here one ſtone upon another, that ſhall not be thrown down.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He had foretold the manner how that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful City ſhould be beſieged, and that dreadful Circumvallation which ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girt it: he likewiſe foretold the diſmal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine which was to fall upon her Citizens, and had not forgot to ſpeak of the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, by whom they ſhould be ſeduced. He had admoniſhed the <hi>Jews</hi> that the time of their Miſery was nigh at hand: he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven certain particular ſigns which were to point out the preciſe moment of it: he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded to them the long Chain of their Sins, which would draw upon them ſo heavy and woful a Puniſhment. In a word, he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the whole Hiſtory of the Siege, and of the Deſolation of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your Highneſs may likewiſe be pleaſed to obſerve, that he made them theſe Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons but a little before his Paſſion, that ſo they might the better underſtand the cauſe of all their Miſeries. His Paſſion was very near when he told them, <hi>Behold,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This was a plain and ſufficient ſetting forth both of the manner of the Siege, and of the laſt effects of Wrath and Vengeance: But <hi>Jeſus</hi> could not yet go to his Croſs without declaring to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the heavy Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was one day to fall on her for that unworthy Treatment he had received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.

They are comprized in that long and admirable Diſcourſe where he joyns together the Ruine of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with that of the Univerſe. That Unity was myſterious, and this the deſign of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that happy City which our Lord had choſen, as long as it kept in the Covenant, and in the Faith of the Promiſes, was the Type of the Church, and the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Heaven, where God diſcovers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:56382:172"/> to his Children. That is the reaſon we oft-times ſee the Prophets to joyn in the Thread of the ſame Diſcourſe,<note place="margin">Matth. 24. Mark 13. Luke 21.</note> what reſpects <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to that which regards the Church and the Celeſtial Glory. 'Tis one of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of the Prophecies, and one of the Keys which opens the Underſtanding of them: But <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as it was reprobate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful towards her Saviour, was to be the Type and Image of Hell. Her perfidious Citizens were to repreſent the damned; and the terrible Judgment which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was to execute upon them, was to be the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of that which he was to bring on all the World when he ſhould come at the end of all things in his glorious Majeſty to judge the quick and the dead. 'Tis the way of the Scripture, and one of the methods it makes uſe of for the imprinting of Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries into our minds, to mingle for our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction Types and Truth together. Thus our Lord hath intermingled the Hiſtory of deſolated <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with that of the end of the World; and this has been plainly viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in all our Diſcourſe of it.</p>
               <p>But however, let us not imagine that theſe things were ſo confounded that we could not diſcern what belonged to each of them. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> has diſtinguiſhed them by certain Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, which I could eaſily make out if there were any queſtion about them. But I will content my ſelf with giving you to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what relates to the Deſolation of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtles (for it was then at the time of the Paſſion) being got together round

That Perſecution which was ſtirred up by the Jealouſies and Violences of the <hi>Jews</hi> haſtened their Ruine, but it did not as yet point out the particular time.</p>
               <p>The coming of falſe Chriſts and falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſeemed to be a nearer ſtep to their laſt ruine: for the ordinary deſtiny of thoſe who refuſed to lend an Ear to the Truth, was to be drawn on to their ruine by the deceiving Prophets. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> did not hide this from his Apoſtles, that this ſhould be the Calamity that ſhould befall the <hi>Jews;</hi> for he ſaid, that <hi>many falſe Prophets ſhould riſe, and

               <p>It ought not to be ſaid that this was an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie thing for any one to divine that knew the humour and complexion of the Nation: for to the contrary I have ſhewn, that the <hi>Jews</hi> being wearied by theſe Seducers, who had ſo often been the cauſe of their ruine, and eſpecially of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> were ſo throughly diſabuſed at laſt, that they left off further hearkening to them.

               <p>One Evangeliſt explains another, and in comparing thoſe Paſſages together, it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy to underſtand that that Abomination fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by <hi>Daniel</hi> was the ſame thing with the Armies round about <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

               <p>The Word <hi>Abomination,</hi> as the holy Language uſes it, ſignifies an Idol; and who does not know that the <hi>Roman</hi> Armies bore
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:56382:176"/> in their Enſigns the Images of their Gods, and of their <hi>Caeſars,</hi> who were had in greater Reverence than all their Gods? Thoſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns were to the Souldiers an Object of worſhip; and becauſe Idols, according to God's Decrees, were never to appear in the holy Land, the <hi>Roman</hi> Enſigns were baniſhed from thence.

                  </note> and they would not force that People to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure things that were ſo contrary to their Law. But in the time of the laſt <hi>Jewiſh</hi> War, it is very much to be believed that the <hi>Romans</hi> did not any whit ſpare a People whom they were reſolved utterly to deſtroy. So that when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was beſieged, it was ſurroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with as many Idols as there were <hi>Roman</hi> Enſigns in the Army, and the Abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did never appear ſo great, <hi>ſtanding where it ought not,</hi> that is to ſay, in the holy Land, and round about the Temple.</p>
               <p>Was this then, may ſome ſay, that great Sign that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was to give? Was it then high time to fly when <hi>Titus</hi> beſieged <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and when he ſo cloſely bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Pious Antiquity has preſerved to us this Prediction of the Apoſtles, which was to be attended with ſo cloſe and ſudden an Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment, St. <hi>Peter</hi> had given them ſeveral others, either from a particular Inſpiration,<note place="margin">Phleg. l. <hi>13, 14.</hi> Chron. apud O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rig. l. <hi>2.</hi> cont.

               <p>So that nothing befel the <hi>Jews</hi> but what was before hand propheſied of them.

               <p>Your Highneſs may ſee therefore that it was in vain for <hi>Titus</hi> to attempt to ſave <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> and the Temple.

And if one <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor vainly attempted to hinder the Ruine of the Temple, another <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor did yet more vainly attempt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>build it. <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, after he had

He excited them to build their Temple; he gave them vaſt ſums of Mony, and aſſiſted them with all the Power of the Empire. But hearken to the event, and you will find how God confounded the proud Princes. The holy Fathers, and the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Hiſtorians, do with one common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent report it, and juſtify it by Monuments which remain ſtill from their time.

But they let ſlip thoſe precious Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities without any whit benefitting themſelves by them; wherefore we have ſeen them afterwards given up to believe a lye, and they never knew ſince what courſe to take.</p>
               <p>Give me leave a little to recount to you the courſe and progreſs of their Errors, and all the Methods they have taken to ſink themſelves into this Abyſs. The ways by which we come to wander, tend always to the broad Road; and by conſidering where our wandring hath begun, we may more ſecurely go on in the right way.</p>
               <p>Your Highneſs hath ſeen, that two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies have ſet forth to the <hi>Jews</hi> the time of Chriſt's coming, that of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and that of <hi>Daniel.</hi> They both did foretell the ruine of the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> at the time of our Saviour's Advent. But <hi>Daniel</hi> revealed how that a total Deſtruction ſhould come upon that Kingdom after the death of Chriſt: and <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid plainly, that in the Declenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> that Chriſt which ſhould then come ſhould be the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the People;</hi> that is to ſay, that he ſhould be the Deliverer of them, and that he ſhould erect to himſelf a new Kingdom, not only framed out of one ſingle People,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:56382:180"/> but out of all the People of the World. The words of the Prophecy can admit of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſe, and it was the conſtant poſitive Tradition of the <hi>Jews</hi> that they were thus to underſtand it.</p>
               <p>From thence that Opinion which was ſpread abroad by the ancient <hi>Rabbies,</hi> and which is yet to be ſeen in their <hi>Talmud,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gem. tr. Sanhed. c. <hi>11.</hi>
                  </note> that at the time that Chriſt was to come, there ſhould be no more Magiſtracy: ſo that there was nothing more neceſſary to make them know the time of their <hi>Meſſias,</hi> than only to obſerve when they were falling into that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Condition.</p>
               <p>In fine, they had begun well, and if they had not had their minds prepoſſeſſed with the worldly Grandeurs which they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to find in their <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and which they thought to have a ſhare of under his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, they could never have been miſtaken in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Foundation they had laid was certain: for as ſoon as the Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the firſt <hi>Herod,</hi> and the change of the Jewiſh Commonwealth which happened in his time, had diſcovered to them the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuality of the Declenſion ſet forth in the Prophecy, they doubted not but that Chriſt was coming, and they ſhould ſee that new Kingdom in which all People were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united.</p>
               <p>One thing which they took notice of, was, that the power of life and death was taken from them.<note place="margin">Talm. Hieroſol. tr. Sanhed. <hi>Dan. 13.</hi>
                  </note> That was a great change, ſince they had ever enjoyed that great privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge till then, to what Dominion ſoever they were ſubjected, nay, even in <hi>Babylon</hi>
                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:56382:180" rendition="simple:additions"/> during their Captivity. The Hiſtory of <hi>Suſanna</hi> plain enough ſhews that, and it was a moſt certain Tradition among them. The Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> who re-eſtabliſhed them,<note place="margin">1 Eſdr. 7.23, 24, 25, 26.</note> left them that power by an expreſs Decree, which has been already obſerved in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place; and we have alſo ſeen that the firſt <hi>Seleucides</hi> had rather enlarged than ſtraitned their Priviledges. I need not here to repeat any thing of the Reign of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> where they were not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchiſed, but became mighty and formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable to their Enemies. <hi>Pompey,</hi> who weakened them, as we have already likewiſe ſeen, being content with the Tribute he had laid upon them, and with putting them in ſuch a condition that the People of <hi>Rome</hi> might diſpoſe of them upon occaſion, left them their Prince, with all his Juriſdiction. It is ſufficiently known that they received ſuch uſage from the <hi>Romans;</hi> and that they never medled with their Government among themſelves in thoſe Countreys where they ſuffered them to have their Natural Kings.</p>
               <p>In fine, the <hi>Jews</hi> were reſolved to loſe that power they had of life and death, but forty years before the Deſtruction of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Temple; and it is to be queſtioned whether this was not the firſt <hi>Herod</hi> that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attempted to make this breach on their Liberty.

One of their moſt ancient Authors takes notice of it, and it is but reaſon in him to acknowledge that the Scepter was not then in <hi>Judah,</hi> nor any Authority among the Heads of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſeeing that the publick Power was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them,<note place="margin">Tract. voc. magn.

Therefore according to their own reckoning, it was much about the time that Chriſt was to appear. And as they ſaw then that certain Sign of this new King's coming to be very near at hand, whoſe Empire was to extend it ſelf over all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they did effectually believe that he would appear.

And altho' throughout the whole courſe of his life, and after his death, he confirm'd his Miſſion by ſo many extraordinary Miracles, yet thoſe beſotted and infatuated Wretches rejected him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they could ſee nothing in him but a ſolid Grandeur which was void of all that ſplendid Decoration which ſtrikes the Senſes, and becauſe he ſeemed rather come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn than to reward their vain Ambition.</p>
               <pb n="353" facs="tcp:56382:183"/>
               <p>And yet however, forced by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctures and Circumſtances of time, in ſpight of their blindneſs and obduracy, they ſometimes ſeemed to vail to their Prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions. Every thing at the time of our Lord was ſo exactly fitted to the Manifeſtation of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> that they were in great ſuſpicion leſt St. <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> might be he.<note place="margin">Luke 3.15. 1 John 19.20.</note> His manner of life, which was auſtere, extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and very ſurprizing, touched them ſenſibly; and tho' the Grandeurs of the World was wanting, yet they appeared at firſt as if they were willing to be ſatisfied with the luſtre of ſo amazing and prodigious a life. The ſimple and common life of our <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was offenſive to thoſe groſs, as well as proud Spirits, who were only capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being taken by their Senſes, and who otherwiſe being far enough from a ſincere Converſion, would admire nothing but what they looked on as inimitable. So that St. <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> who they thought deſerved to be the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was not believed when he declared to them the true Chriſt: and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whom they muſt have imitated as ſoon as they had believed on him, appeared to the <hi>Jews</hi> too humble and meek for them to follow him.</p>
               <p>But yet the Impreſſion that was made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, that <hi>Christ</hi> muſt appear about that time, was ſo ſtrong and powerful, that they could not wear it off for almoſt a whole Age.

                  <hi>Joſephus</hi> is here moſt mightily deceived.

               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> that came after him would fain have ſupplied this Defect. They have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to us an <hi>Agrippa</hi> deſcended from <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> whom the <hi>Romans,</hi> they ſaid, did put to death a little before the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> And they would needs have that <hi>Agrippa,</hi> Chriſt by his Title of King, to be the Chriſt which is ſpoken of in <hi>Daniel:</hi> a new Proof of their Blindneſs indeed!

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:56382:186"/> that that <hi>Agrippa</hi> could neither be the Juſt, nor the Saint of Saints, nor the end of the Prophecies, ſo as the Chriſt whom <hi>Daniel</hi> deſcribes in that place was to be; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that the Murther of that <hi>Agrippa,</hi> whereof the <hi>Jews</hi> were innocent, could not be the cauſe of their Deſolation; as the Death of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Death was to be; which here the <hi>Jews</hi> ſay was a Fable. <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi> deſcended from <hi>Herod,</hi> was ever a Party of the <hi>Romans,</hi> ever civilly treated by their Emperors,<note place="margin">Joſeph. l. <hi>7.</hi> de bell.

               <p>Let them anſwer the Prophecies as they would; the Deſolation which they foretold came upon them juſt at the appointed time; the Event was of more Efficacy and Force than all their Subtilties; and if <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not come juſt upon that fatal Conjuncture, the Prophets in whom they truſted very much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And for the Complement of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, pleaſe to obſerve two Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which accompained their Fall, and the Advent of the Saviour of the World: The one is, that the Succeſſion of the High-Prieſts which was perpetual and unalterable ſince <hi>Aaron,</hi> then came to an end: The other, that the Diſtinction of the Tribes and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies allways kept up till that time, was then no more by their own Confeſſion.</p>
               <p>That Diſtinction was neceſſary till the coming of Meſſiah. From <hi>Levi</hi> were to be born the Miniſters of ſacred Things: From <hi>Aaron</hi> were to come the Prieſts and the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifs: From <hi>Juda</hi> the Meſſiah himſelf. If the diſtinction of Families had not continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the coming of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sacrifices would have ceaſed before the time, and <hi>David</hi> had been fruſtrated of the Glory of being known for the Father of the Meſſiah. Was the Meſſiah come? Was the new Prieſthood, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Order of <hi>Melchizedech</hi> begun in his Perſon? And the new Kingdom, which was not of this World, did that too appear? Then was there no longer need of <hi>Aaron,</hi> nor of <hi>Levi,</hi> nor of <hi>Juda,</hi> nor of <hi>David,</hi> nor of their Families. <hi>Aaron</hi> was no more neceſſary then, when the Sacrifices were to ceaſe as <hi>Daniel</hi> had foretold. The Houſe of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Juda</hi> had accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their purpoſe when that the Chriſt of God was come out from thence:<note place="margin">Dan. 9.27.</note> And as if the <hi>Jew;</hi> themſelves had renounced their own Hopes, they particularly at that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got the Succeſſion of Families, until then

               <p>Let us not omit one of the Signs of the Meſſiah's coming, and peradventure the chiefeſt, if we can tell how to underſtand it aright, tho' it be to the Scandal as well as Horror of the <hi>Jews.</hi> 'Tis the Remiſſion of Sins declared in the name of a ſuffering Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,<note place="margin">Dan. 9.26, 27.</note> of a Saviour humble and obedient even to the Death. <hi>Daniel</hi> had obſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his Weeks, the myſterious Week which here we take notice of, wherein Chriſt was to be ſacrificed, wherein the Covenant was to be confirmed by his Death, and the antient Sacrifices were to loſe their Power and Vertue.

               <p>Alſo we ſee ſince that time indiſputable Marks of their Reprobation.

               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath unfolded to us that great Myſtery in the firſt Chapter of the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and it is worth our while to conſider that admirable Place with the following words. <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſent me to preach the Goſpel,</hi>

But ſee what reaſon St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives of it. 'Tis <hi>after that in the Wiſdom of God, the World by Wiſdom knew not God,</hi> by the works of his Wiſdom, that is to ſay by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which he had ſo wiſely ordained, he took another way, <hi>it pleaſed God by the fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs of Preaching to ſave them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21.</note> that is to ſay, by the Myſtery of the Croſs, which the Wiſdom of this World cannot underſtand.</p>
               <p>A new and admirable deſign of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence! God had brought man into the World, where on what ſide ſoever he turn'd his Eyes, the Wiſdom of the Creator was illuſtriouſly eminent in the greatneſs, richneſs, and diſpoſition of ſo excellent work. Yet Blind and Ignorant, he miſtook him; the Creatures which preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to raiſe up our Minds higher, fixed them here below; blind and brutiſh Man fell down to them, and not content to adore only the Works of God's Hand, they fell adoring the work of their own. Even more extravagantly ridiculous fables, than thoſe which old Women pleaſe Children with, conſtituted their Religion: Reaſon they had forgot, and God was reſolved to make them forget it in another manner. One work, the Wiſdom of which they underſtood, wrought no impreſſion in them, and another work was preſented to them, where their reaſon was loſt, and every thing
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:56382:191"/> appeared fooliſhneſs to them that was the Croſs of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It is not by reaſoning that this Myſtery is underſtood; <hi>it is in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the knowledg of God,</hi>

                  <hi>and bringing into Captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In fine, how are we to underſtand this Myſtery, where the Lord of Life and Glory is loaded with reproaches; where the Wiſdom of God is accounted fooliſhneſs; where he, who being in himſelf aſſured of his natural Greatneſs, <hi>thought he attributed nothing to himſelf when he ſaid he was equal with God, and yet took upon him the form of a Servant, and was made in the likeneſs of Men;</hi>

                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 11.7, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>and being found in faſhion as a Man, he humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto Death, even the death of the Croſs?</hi> all our thoughts are here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded; and as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, there is nothing which appears more extravagant and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to thoſe that are not enlightned from above.</p>
               <p>Such was the Remedy which God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for Idolatry. He knew the Spirit of Man, and knew that it was not by reaſon that an errour muſt be deſtroyed which had not its Eſtabliſhment from Reaſon. There are ſome Errours we fall into by reaſon; for oft-times Man does embroil and entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle himſelf by diſputation and argument: But Idolatry came in by an extreme quite different and oppoſite; by ſtifling all reaſon, and by giving the Dominion to Senſe which loves to cover every thing over with ſuch qualities as touch that with the moſt
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:56382:192"/> agreeable delight and pleaſure. 'Twas by that the Divinity became viſible and groſs. Men attributed their own figures to it, and that which was yet more ſhameful and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, their very Vices and Paſſions. Reaſon bore no part in this ſo brutiſh an Error. 'Twas the overthrow of all good Senſe, a meer delirium, a Phrenſy. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or argue with one that is Phrenitick, and diſpute againſt a Man, whom the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of a Feaver has made Light-headed; you only incenſe him, and make the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper more incureable. We ought to go to the cauſe, to correct the Temper, and calm the Humours that cauſe by their extravagance ſuch ſtrange tranſports: And ſo it muſt not be reaſon that cures the deliri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um of Idolatry. What have the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers got with all their pompous Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, with the ſublimity of their Stile, and with their Arguments ſo artfully managed? <hi>Plato</hi> with his Eloquence, which was thought to have ſomewhat divine in it, what one ſingle Altar has it thrown down, where thoſe monſtrous divinities were adored? On the contrary, both he, and his Diſciples, and all the Sages of the Age Sacrificed to a lye: <hi>becauſe that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their Imaginations,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Was it not therefore with great reaſon that St. <hi>Paul</hi> brake out with that paſſage,

                  <hi>where is the diſputer of this World? hath not God made fooliſh the wiſdom of this World?</hi> Have they ever been able by themſelves to deſtroy the Fables of Idolatry? did it ſo much as ever come into their thoughts, that they ought openly to ſet themſelves againſt ſo many Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, and ſuffer, I do not ſay, the heavieſt Puniſhments, but the leaſt affront or injury from the Truth? So far were they from this, <hi>that they have held the truth in unrighteouſneſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 1.18.</note> and have laid down for a maxime, that in matters of Religion, one ought to follow the People: the People whom they deſpiſed and ſcorn'd ſo much, was their rule in the moſt important matter of all, and where their illuminations ſeemed to be moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. What ſervice then, O Philoſophy, haſt thou done? <hi>hath not God made fooliſh the Wiſdom of this World,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tell us?<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.19, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>and hath not he deſtroyed the Wiſdom of the Wiſe, and brought to nothing the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Prudent?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus hath God ſhewn by experience, that the deſtruction of Idolatry could not be alone the work of Humane Reaſon. He was ſo far from committing the Cure of ſuch a Malady to that, that God hath perfectly confounded it by the Myſtery of the Croſs, and he hath at once brought the Remedy even to the Source and Root of the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
               <p>Idolatry, if we underſtand it aright, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived its Birth from that profound Love and Inclination we had to our ſelves. 'Twas that made us to invent Gods after our own
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:56382:193"/> Image: Gods who effectually were but Men ſubject to the like Paſſions, Weakneſſes, and Vices with our ſelves; ſo that under the name of falſe Divinities, 'twas in effect, their own Imaginations, Pleaſures, and Phancies, which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> worſhipped.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> makes us to enter by other ways. His Poverty, his Ignominies, and his Croſs make him appear an Object hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to our Senſes. We muſt come out of our ſelves, renounce all, and crucifie all to follow him. Man rooted out of himſelf, and from every thing which his Corruption made him in love with, became capable to adore God, and his Eternal Truth, whoſe Rules he is willing for the future to obey.</p>
               <p>Thus all the Idols were deſtroyed and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, both thoſe which were worſhipped upon the Altars, and they which were ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in each man's private Breaſt. Theſe had erected others. <hi>Venus</hi> was worſhipped, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they attributed to her a Dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Love, and they were charmed with her Power. <hi>Bacchus,</hi> the moſt wanton of all the Gods, had his Altars, becauſe men gave up themſelves to his Careſſes, and ſacrificed, I may venture to ſay, to the joy of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, more pleaſant and drunken, than the Wine it ſelf. But <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> by the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of his Croſs came to impreſs into their hearts the Love of Sufferings in the room of Pleaſures. The Idols which they outwardly adored were deſtroyed, becauſe thoſe which they inwardly worſhipped, ſubſiſted no longer: the purified heart, as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf hath ſaid,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.8.</note> became capable of ſeeing God;
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:56382:193"/> and then Man was ſo far from making God like to himſelf, that he rather ſtrove, as much as his Infirmity would ſuffer him, to become like unto God.</p>
               <p>The Myſtery of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to us, how the Divinity, without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing it ſelf, may be united to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and be clothed with our Weakneſſes. The Word was made Fleſh; He that had <hi>the form</hi> and nature of God, without loſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that he was, <hi>took upon him the form of a Servant.</hi> Inalterable in himſelf, he yet appropriates to himſelf a ſtranger Nature. O ye Men, you would need have Gods that were indeed but Men, and thoſe too that were vitious! Was not that a great blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? But here is a new Object of Adoration propoſed to you; 'tis God and Man both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but ſuch a Man that hath loſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what he was, in taking upon him to be as we are. The Divinity remains im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, and without a poſſibility of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing degraded; that cannot but raiſe up what it unites.</p>
               <p>But let us conſider, What is it that God hath taken from us? are they our Vices, and our Sins? God forbid: he only took from Man what he made in him, and it is moſt certain that he neither made Sin nor Vice in him. Nature was made, and that he took. We may ſay that he made Mortality and Infirmity to accompany it, becauſe although it was not in the firſt deſign, it was the juſt puniſhment of Sin, and in that reſpect it was the work of the Divine Juſtice. So God has not diſdained to take it; and in taking
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:56382:194"/> upon him the puniſhment of Sin without the Sin it ſelf, he ſhewed that he was not a Guilty one that was puniſhed, but the Juſt that died to expiate the Sins of the world.</p>
               <p>So that inſtead of the Vices which men put into their Gods, all the Vertues appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that God-Man; and that they might appear in him in the laſt Trials, they were ſeen to attend him in the midſt of the moſt dreadful Torments. Let us not therefore look for any other viſible God after him; he alone is worthy to aboliſh all Idols; and the Victory he was to gain over them was faſtened to his Croſs.</p>
               <p>That is to ſay, it was faſtened to a moſt apparent folly.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.22, 23, 24, &amp; 25.</note> 
                  <hi>For the Jews,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> goes on, <hi>require a ſign,</hi> whereby God, in putting even the whole Frame of Nature into a Convulſion, as he did at the <hi>Iſraèlites</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſet them viſibly above their Enemies, <hi>and the</hi> Greeks <hi>or the</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles <hi>ſeek after wiſdom</hi> and laboured diſcourſes, as thoſe of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> were; <hi>but we,</hi> continues the Apoſtle, <hi>preach Chriſt crucified, unto the</hi> Jews <hi>a ſtumbling block,</hi> and not a Miracle, <hi>and unto the</hi> Greeks <hi>fooliſhneſs,</hi> and not wiſdom: <hi>but unto them who are called both</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Greeks, <hi>Chriſt, the Power of God, and the Wiſdom of God: becauſe the fooliſhneſs of God is wiſer than all the wiſdom of Men, and the weakneſs of God is ſtronger than the mightieſt of Humane Power.</hi> This, this was to be the laſt blow (as I may ſay) to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to our proud Ignorance. The wiſdom to which that brings us is ſo ſublime and lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that it appears fooliſhneſs to our wiſdom,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:56382:194"/> and the Rules of it are ſo high and eminent, that every thing in it ſeems to us a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wherein we are loſt.</p>
               <p>But tho' that Divine Wiſdom was in it ſelf impenetrable to us, yet it ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it ſelf by its effects. A virtue comes out of the Croſs, and all the Idols are ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. We ſee them fall flat on the ground, although they were kept up and maintained by all the <hi>Roman</hi> Power. 'Twas not the Wiſe, nor the Noble, nor the Mighty that wrought ſo great a Miracle. The work of God was followed, and what he had begun by the Humiliation of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and compleated by the Humiliation of his Diſciples. <hi>Ye ſee your Calling, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> goes St. <hi>Paul</hi> on with that admirable Diſcourſe of his, the calling of which that victorious Church of the World was framed and compoſed,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.26, 27, 28, 29.</note> 
                  <hi>how that not many wiſe men after the fleſh,</hi> whom the World has in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, <hi>not many mighty, not many noble are called, but God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world, to confound the wiſe: and God hath choſen the weak things of the world, to confound the things which are mighty; and baſe things of the world, and things which are deſpiſed, hath God choſen; yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are, that no fleſh ſhould glory in his Preſence.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and their Diſciples, the Off-ſcouring of the World, and even Nothing it ſelf, in beholding them with Humane Eyes, have prevailed over all the Emperours, and all Empire. Men had forgot the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and God renewed it, by bringing out
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:56382:195"/> of that Nothing his Church, which he hath made all powerful againſt what Errour ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. With the Idols hath he confounded all the Humane Greatneſs which was enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in their Defence; and he hath wrought as great a Work, as he did when he made the World, by the alone power of his word.</p>

               <p>How powerful is Intereſt, and how bold and daring is Man when he can but cloak himſelf under the pretence of Religion! There was nothing more needful to open the Mouths of thoſe that were of like Occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with him.

<pb n="378" facs="tcp:56382:196"/> in Travel into the Theatre,</hi> where the whole City was met in Confuſion.

But God was reſolved to make us ſee that the eſtabliſhing of the true Religion did not create ſuch Troubles, and that was one great Token that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed in that work. For who can chooſe but wonder, when he conſiders that for three hundred years together, whilſt the Church was ſuffering all the Cruelties that the Rage of Perſecutors were able to invent, amidſt ſo many Seditions, ſo many Wars, and ſo many Conſpiracies againſt the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Emperours,<note place="margin">Tertul.

               <p>That beautiful diſtinction filled their minds with ſo clear a light, that never did Chriſtians fail in their reſpect to the Image of God in Princes, tho' they were Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Truth. That Character of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion ſo ſhone in all their Apologies, that they do to this day inſpire thoſe that read them with a Love of Publick Order, and do ſhow that they expect only from God the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment of Chriſtianity.

               <p>Indeed it was hard for them to be treated as Publick Enemies, and as Enemies to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours; Thoſe, I may ſay, who breathed nothing but Obedience, and whoſe moſt devout and ſervent Prayers were ſtill for the ſafety of their Princes, and the happineſs of the State.

She fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied ſhe owed her Victories to her Religion, and by that had ſubdued both Nations and their Gods, for ſo at that time was their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning: ſo that the <hi>Roman</hi> Gods were to be ſuperiour to all other, the <hi>Romans</hi> were Maſters of other men.<note place="margin">Cic.

                  <hi>Rome,</hi> in ſubjecting <hi>Judea,</hi> reckoned the God of the <hi>Jews</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe other Gods ſhe had vanquiſhed: The deſire of reigning, was the overthrow or the Foundations of the Empire; the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Victories and Power of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Rome.</hi> Thus the Chriſtians, who
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:56382:197"/> were Enemies of their Gods, were at the ſame time looked upon as Enemies of the Republick.

But they were out in their Boaſtings, that they had deſtroyed a Religion which grew (tho' inſenſibly) greater under its Perſecution of Fire and the Sword. Calumnies in vain were added to Cruelty. Men who were vertuous in their Practices even above Mankind, were yet condemned as being guilty of thoſe Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are a ſhock and horrour to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature. Thoſe were reproached for inceſtuous Perſons who made Chaſtity to be the glory of their Lives; and others were accuſed of eating up their own Children, who were kind and beneficent to their very Perſecutors. But notwithſtanding all that publick hatred, the force and power of truth drew from the mouths of their moſt violent Enemies very favourable Teſtimonies of them.<note place="margin">Plin. l. <hi>10.</hi> Ep. <hi>97.</hi>
                  </note> Every one knows what <hi>Pliny</hi> the younger writ to <hi>Trajan</hi> concerning the Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the Chriſtians.

               <p>Idolatry did not put all its force to the laſt
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:56382:198"/> violence. Although its Foundation was a brutiſh Ignorance, and an entire deprivation of Humane Senſe, yet it was willing to ſet it off with the colour of ſome Reaſon. How often has it endeavoured to be in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe and maſque? and in how many ways has it been transformed, that ſo the ſhame of it may be concealed? Sometimes it was for paying all imaginable reſpect to the Divinity; ſaying whatſoever was Divine, muſt needs be unknown: For only the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity can underſtand it ſelf. 'Tis not for ſuch groveling Duſt as we to diſcover things ſo high and elevated; wherefore it becomes us to believe the Antients; and every one ought to follow the Religion he finds by Law eſtabliſhed in his Countrey. And by theſe Maxims, thoſe groſs, as well as impious Errors, which had ſpead themſelves over all the habitable World, were reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dileſs, and the voice of Nature, which de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clared the true God, was ſtifled, and not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to ſpeak.</p>
               <p>There was then great ground to think that the weakneſs of our ſtrayed Reaſon had need of an Authority to call it back to its firſt Principle; and that it ought from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity to learn the true Religion.

But from what Antiquity can Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm boaſt it ſelf, which can't read its own Hiſtorie, but in them muſt find the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal not only of its Religion, but alſo of its Gods?<note place="margin">De natur.

                  <hi>Varro</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> not to mention o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Authors, have ſufficiently made this
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:56382:198"/> plain. Or ſhall we have recourſe to thoſe numberleſs Thouſands of Years which were filled up by the <hi>Egyptians</hi> with confuſed and impertinent Fables, for the eſtabliſhing of that Antiquity, of which they boaſted ſo much? There we ſhall ſtill ſee in them the Riſe and Fall, the Birth and Death of the Gods of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and that People cannot pretend to their Antientneſs, but they muſt at the ſame time ſhew us the beginning of their Gods.</p>
               <p>But let us ſee another Form and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Idolatry, that directed every one that went by us to be look'd on as Divine. The <hi>Roman</hi> Polity, which ſo ſeverely interdicted ſtrange Religions, yet permitted Adoration to be given to the Gods of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> ſo that it had adopted tliem. Thus it endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to appear equitable as well towards all Gods as towards all Men. Sometimes it offered Incenſe to the God of the <hi>Jews</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all the reſt.<note place="margin">Jul. Ep. ad comm. Judaeor.</note> And we find a Letter of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, whereby he promiſes the <hi>Jews</hi> to re-build the Holy City, and with them to ſacrifice to God the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the Univerſe. 'Twas a common Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. We have ſeen the Heathen willing to worſhip the true God, tho' not to worſhip him alone; and the Emperors did not ſtick even to give <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf, whoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples they perſecuted, ſome Altars among the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What then? Could the <hi>Romans</hi> ever imagine they ſhould honour him as God, whom their Magiſtrates had condemned to the cruelleſt, as well as the vileſt of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:56382:199"/> and whom ſeveral of their Authors have loaded with very reproachful Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies? And yet we need not wonder at it, for the thing is beyond all Controverſy.</p>
               <p>Firſt let us diſtinguiſh what in general a blind Hatred ſays, from poſitive Facts the Proofs whereof are alledged. 'Tis certain that the <hi>Romans,</hi> though they condemned <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> yet never reproached him for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Crime in particular: So <hi>Pilate</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him with Repugnance, being violently carried away by the Clamors and Menaces of the <hi>Jews.</hi> But that which is more to be wondered at, is, the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, at whoſe Importunities he was crucified, have not preſerved in any other of their antient Books, the Remembrance of any one ſingle Action which might caſt a Blemiſh upon his Life; ſo far have they been from obſerving any that might make him to deſerve ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere a Puniſhment as his Crucifixion; whereby is confirmed in a moſt plain and manifeſt manner what we read in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that all the Crime of our Lord was, for calling himſelf Chriſt, the Son of God.</p>
               <p>Indeed <hi>Tacitus</hi> tells us of the Puniſhment of our bleſſed Saviour under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> and during the Empire of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> but ſays not a word of any Crime that might make him worthy of Death, but only that of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Author of a Sect convicted for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Mankind, or at leaſt for being odious to it. Such was the Crime of our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and of the Chriſtians; and their greateſt Enemies could never accuſe them but in dubious terms, for they were never
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:56382:199" rendition="simple:additions"/> able to alledge one poſitive Fact as could fairly be imputed to them.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, in the laſt Perſecution, and three hundred Years after Chriſt, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then who were at a loſs how then to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Reproach either upon him or his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, publiſhed ſome <hi>

But as not a word of thoſe Acts were ever heard ſpoke of in all the precedent Ages, and that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under <hi>Nero,</hi> nor under <hi>Domitian,</hi> who reigned in the beginning of Chriſtianity, how great Enemies ſoever they were of it, there is nothing at all ſound concerning them; it is very probable they were made out of their own Fancy; and among the <hi>Romans</hi> there are found ſo few conſtant Proofs of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that his Enemies have been forced to fly to their Inventions to make ſome.</p>
               <p>Here then is one and the firſt thing to be conſidered of, the Innocence of our Bleſſed Saviour irreproachable. Let us now ſubjoin a ſecond, the Holineſs of his Life, and his known and exemplary Doctrine. One of the greateſt <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, to wit,<note place="margin">Lamprid. in Alex.

The ſame Emperor commended, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for an Example, the holy Precauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wherewith the Chriſtians ordained the Miniſters of Sacred things. That was not all neither: There was ſeen in his Palace a kind of Chappel, where he ſacrificed in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.<note place="margin">

               <p>But beſides the Innocency and Holineſs of our bleſſed Saviour, there is yet a third Point which is of no leſs Moment and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and that is his Miracles.

                  </note> the more to obſcure and hide them, they ſaid that he had done them by the Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he had learnt in <hi>Egypt;</hi> or rather by the name of God, that unknown and inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable Name, whoſe Virtue can do all thing, as the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves acknowledge, and that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had diſcovered they know not how, in the Sanctuary; or elſe, becauſe he was one of thoſe Prophets taken notice of by <hi>Moſes,</hi> whoſe deceitful Miracles were to ſeduce the People to Idolatry. <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> the Aboliſher of Idols, whoſe Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel preached up the acknowledging of one only God throughout all the World, ſtands in no need of being juſtified from that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; the true Prophets have no leſs preached up his Divinity than he hath done
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:56382:201"/> himſelf; and that which is the Reſult of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Teſtimony, is that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> wrought Miracles to juſtify his Miſſion.</p>
               <p>Now when they calumniouſly ſaid that he wrought them by Magick, they would do well to conſider that <hi>Moſes</hi> was accuſed of the ſame Crime.

               <p>But if the Pride of the Platoniſts could not be brought down to the Humiliations of the Word made Fleſh, might they not at leaſt be brought to underſtand that Man, for being but little lower than the Angels, was as capable of poſſeſſing God as they, ſo that he was rather their Brother than their Subject, and therefore he ought not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore them, but to adore with them in the Spirit of Society, him who had made them both after his own Image and reſemblance?

               <p>Here it was that Idolatry, which ſeemed to be at a full Stand, did entirely diſcover

The holineſs of the Chriſtians behaviour, the contempt of the Pleaſures that it commanded, and what is yet more than all, the Humility which made up (as it were) the whole of the Chriſtian Life, theſe things offended Mankind; and if we can comprehend it, Pride, Senſuality, and Libertiniſm were the only Guards and Defences of Idolatry.</p>
               <p>The Church was every day pulling it up by the Roots by her Doctrine, but yet more by her Patience. Yet thoſe wicked Spirits who were never weary of deceiving men, and who had plunged them into Idolatry, were not now forgetful of their Malice. They ſtarted up thoſe Hereſies in the Church which you have heard of. The curious and inquiſitive men, and by that means vain and fickle, and lovers of novelty, would fain get to themſelves a name among the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and could not be contented with that ſober and temperate Wiſdom which the Apoſtle had ſo much recommended to the Chriſtians. They launched too deep into thoſe Myſteries which they pretended to meaſure out to our weak conceptions: New Philoſophers that mingled Humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings with Faith, and undertook to leſſen
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:56382:205"/> the difficulties of Chriſtianity, being able to digeſt all that folly which the World found in the Goſpel. Thus ſucceſſively, and with a kind of Method, were all the Articles of our Faith aſſaulted: the Creation, the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> a neceſſary Foundation of ours, the Divinity of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> his Incarnation, his Grace, his Sacraments, in ſhort every thing occaſioned matters for thoſe ſcandalous Diviſions.<note place="margin">Orig. lib. <hi>5.</hi> cont.

                  <hi>Celſus</hi> and others reproached us for them. Idolatry ſeemed to ride in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. It looked on Chriſtianity as a new Sect of Philoſophy which had the fate of all others, and like them dwindled away of it ſelf into ſeveral other Sects. The Church ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them but a Humane Work that was ready to fall of it ſelf. And they concluded that it was not neceſſary in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to refine more than our Anceſtors, nor to attempt to change the World.</p>
               <p>In this Confuſion of Sects which boaſted themſelves to be Chriſtians, God wanted not his Church.

'Tis certain that they were the only People who originally knew God the Creator of Heaven and Earth; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the only People to whom the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Secrets were to be committed.

It has been only the <hi>Jews</hi> who have had the Sacred Scriptures in ſo much the greater Veneration, as they were the more known. Of all the ancient Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, theſe alone preſerved the Primitive Monuments of their Religion, albeit they ſo fully gave teſtimony of their Infidelity, with that of their Anceſtors. And at this very day do this People ſtill remain upon the Earth, to carry into all Nations where they are diſperſed, together with the courſe and progreſs of their Religion, the Miracles and Predictions which render it immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was come, and ſent by his Father to accompliſh the Promiſes of the Law, he confirmed his Miſſion, and that of his Diſciples by new Miracles, which
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:56382:208"/> have been alſo written with the ſame exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The Acts of them have been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed all the World over; the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Time, Perſons, and Places have made the <hi>Examen</hi> eaſie to all that have been careful of their Salvation. The World was informed, the World has believed, and if we have but ever ſo little conſidered the ancient Monuments of the Church, we muſt avow that never has any thing been deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined with more of reflection and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>But as to the Relation which the Books of the two Teſtaments have to one another, there is one difference to be conſidered, that is, that the Books of the ancient People were compoſed at divers times. Some are the times of <hi>Moſes;</hi> others thoſe of <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the <hi>Judges;</hi> and others of the <hi>Kings;</hi> ſome are thoſe when the People were brought out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and received the Law; others thoſe when they obtained the promiſed Land; and others thoſe when they were re-eſtabliſhed by viſible Miracles. To convince the incredulity of a People who were wholly devoted to their Senſes, God took a long extent of Ages in which he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed his Miracles and his Prophets, that ſo he might often renew the ſenſible Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies by which he atteſted his holy Truths. In the New Teſtament he tooks another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. He would no more reveal any thing anew to his Church after <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> In him was perfection and fulneſs; and all the Divine Books that have been compoſed in the New Teſtament, were made in the times of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <pb n="404" facs="tcp:56382:209"/>
               <p>That is to ſay, that the Teſtimony of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and of thoſe whom <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath been pleaſed to chooſe for the Witneſſes of his Reſurrection hath been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the Chriſtian Church. All that has come ſince has edified it, but it has not been looked upon as purely inſpired by God, but what the Apoſtles have written, or what they have confirmed by their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
               <p>But in that difference which is found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Books of the two Teſtaments, God hath always obſerved that admirable order, of making things to be written juſt at the times when they happened, or at leaſt when the memory of them was very freſh. And ſo thoſe that knew them, wrote them: thoſe that knew them received the Books which bore witneſs of them: and both the one and the other have left them to their Poſterity as a moſt precious and invaluable Inheritance; and they moſt carefully and piouſly have preſerved them.</p>
               <p>And thus was formed the Body of the Holy Scriptures, as well the Old as the New Teſtament: Scriptures, which from their Original have been regarded as true in the whole, as given by God himſelf, and which have been alſo kept with that great Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it was thought none could dare to alter the leaſt Letter of it without a ſtrange Impiety.</p>
               <p>And thus it was that they came down to us, always holy, always ſacred, always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable; the one kept by the conſtant Tradition of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the other by
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:56382:209"/> the Tradition of the Chriſtians, ſo much the more certain as it was confirmed by the Blood and Martyrdom, as well of thoſe who wrote thoſe Divine Books, as of them that received 'em.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and the other Fathers demand upon whoſe Faith we attribute the profane Books to certain Times and Authors.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. cont. Fauſt.</hi> 11. 2. 32. 21. 33. 6.</note> Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one readily anſwers, that the Books are diſtinguiſhed by the different Relations they have to the Laws, Cuſtoms, and Hiſtories of a certain Time, by the Stile it ſelf, which bears impreſſed the Character of particular Ages and Authors; and more than all that,<note place="margin">Iren. <hi>1.2.17.</hi> Tertul. adv.

All theſe things concur to the eſtabliſhment of the Divine Books, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the Times, and to mark out the Authors of them; and the more Religion there was in preſerving them entire, the more indiſputable is the Tradition which preſerved them for us.</p>
               <p>Thus hat it been always acknowledged, not only by the Orthodox, but alſo by He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, and even by Infidels. <hi>Moſes</hi> has ever paſſed in all the Eaſt, and afterwards in all the World, for the Legiſlator of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and for being the Author of thoſe Books that are attributed to him. The <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans,</hi> who had received them from the ten ſeparated Tribes, have as religiouſly kept them as the <hi>Jews.</hi> You have ſeen their Tradition and their Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>Two People ſo oppoſite took them not one from the other, but both received them from their Common Original in the Times
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:56382:210"/> of <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>David.</hi> The ancient He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Characters, which the <hi>Samaritans</hi> ſtill retain, do ſufficiently ſhew that they have not followed <hi>Eſdras,</hi> who changed them. Thus the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> are two compleat Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, independant one on the other. The perfect conformity that is ſeen in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Texts, juſtifies the Sincerity of both thoſe People. They are faithful Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that agree without underſtanding one another, or to ſpeak better, who agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether notwithſtanding all their Enmities,<note place="margin">

               <p>Thoſe therefore who ſay, tho' without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſon, that thoſe Books being loſt, or having never been, were ſet up, or compoſed a new, or altered by <hi>Eſdras;</hi> beſides their being contradicted by <hi>Eſdras</hi> himſelf, as may very well be obſerved in the courſe of his Hiſtory, are likewiſe ſo by the <hi>Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch,</hi> which is even now at this day to be ſeen in the hands of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> ſo as it had been read in the firſt Agas by <hi>Euſebius</hi> of <hi>Ceſaria,</hi> St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> and the other Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Author; ſo as thoſe People had kept it in their Original: and a Sect ſo weak as that ſeems not to continue ſo long, but to bear this Teſtimony to the Antiquity of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Authors that wrote the four Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts received no leſs aſſured Teſtimony from the unanimous conſent of the Faithful, the Heathens, and the Hereticks. That great Number of various People who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:56382:210"/> and tranſlated thoſe Divine Books as ſoon as they were made, agree in their date and in their Authors. The Heathens have not contradicted this Tradition. Nor <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> who attacked thoſe Sacred Books even in the firſt beginning of Chriſtianity; nor <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, tho' he was neither ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of any thing, nor omitted any thing that might deſcredit them; nor has any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Heathen ever ſuſpected them to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſititious; but on the contrary, they have all given them the ſame Authors as the Chriſtians. The Hereticks, although they were confounded by the Authority of thoſe Books, yet durſt not ſay that they were not of the Diſciples of our Lord. Nay ſome of thoſe Hereticks ſaw the beginnings of the Church, and before whoſe eyes were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Books of the Goſpel.

                  </gap>ul. 'Tis true, after the time of the Apoſtles, and when the Church was already ſpread over the face of the Earth, <hi>Marcion</hi> and <hi>Mannes</hi> always the moſt raſh, and the moſt ignorant of all the Hereticks, notwithſtanding the Tradition coming from the Apoſtles, co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued by their Diſciples, and by the Biſhops to whom they had left their Chair and the Conduct of the People, and unanimouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by all the Chriſtian Church, were ſo bold as to ſay that there Evangeliſts were ſuppoſititious, and that that of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> which they preferred to all the others, they knew not why ſince it came by no other way, had been falſified. But what proofs gave
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:56382:211"/> they of this? nothing but meer Viſions, no poſitive Matters of Fact. All the reaſon they gave was, that what was contrary to their Sentiments, muſt neceſſarily have been invented by others than by the Apoſtles, and, for all their proof, they alledged the very Opinions which were in Controverſie: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions otherwiſe ſo extravagant, and ſo manifeſtly mad, that it is not to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined how they could ever enter into the mind of man to conceive. But certainly to accuſe the Sincerity of the Church, one muſt have in ones hands Originals quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from thoſe of hers, or ſome demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative proof. But they and their Diſciples being called upon to produce ſome, they are ſtruck dumb, and have left by their Silence an undoubted proof, that in the ſecond Age of Chriſtianity in which they wrote, there was not only an Index and manifeſt ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Falſity in them,<note place="margin">Iren. Tertul. Aug. loc. cit.</note> but there was not the leaſt Conjecture that could be oppoſed to the Tradition of the Church.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſay of the Conſent and Harmony that is to be found in the Books of the Scripture, and of that admirable Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony which all the Times of the People of God gave one to the other? The Times of the Second Temple preſuppoſe thoſe of the Firſt, and carry us back to <hi>Solomon.</hi> Peace was only eſtabliſhed by Combats and Fightings, and the Conqueſts of God's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple return us to the Times of the <hi>Judges,</hi> to <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> and to the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s coming out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> In reflecting upon an entire People's coming out of a Kingdom
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:56382:211"/> where they were Strangers, we ſhall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how they got in thither. The twelve Patriarchs appeared immediately, and a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that were never look'd upon but as one ſingle Family, leads us naturally up to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> who was the Main-ſtock of it. Were thoſe People more wiſe, and leſs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to Idolatry after their return out of <hi>Babylon?</hi> It was the natural effect of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Chaſtiſement, which their own paſt Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences had drawn upon them. If that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple boaſted that they had ſeveral Ages ſeen Miracles which never other People had ſeen, they might alſo boaſt that they had had the knowledge of God which no other People had. What would any have Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, the Feaſt of Tabernacles, the Paſſover, and the other celebrated Feaſts in the Nation Time out of mind to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, if not the things we find taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of in the Books of <hi>Moſes?</hi> that a People diſtinguiſhed from all others, by a Religion, and by a Carriage ſo very peculiar, who had kept from its Original upon the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Creation, and upon the Faith of Providence, a Doctrine ſo followed and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, a ſo lively Remembrance of a long Succeſſion of Facts ſo neceſſarily chained to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, Ceremonies ſo regulated, and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms ſo univerſal, ſhould be without a Hiſtory to recount their Origine, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Law to preſcribe Cuſtoms to them for a thouſand years whilſt it continued in that Eſtate, and that <hi>Eſdras</hi> ſhould all on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den begin to give them under the Name of <hi>Moſes,</hi> with a Hiſtory of their Antiquities,

               <p>To loſe ſuch a Law, after one has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, either a People ought to be quite exterminated, or elſe, through divers Changes, be brought to ſuch a paſs that they have nothing but a confuſed Idea of their Original, Religion, and Cuſtoms.

Everything there ſpeaks of <hi>Moſes,</hi> every thing there is ſounded upon <hi>Moſes;</hi> and indeed every thing ought to be ſo, for that <hi>Moſes</hi> and his Law, and the Hiſtory which he wrote was effectually in the <hi>Jews</hi> all the Foundation both of their publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Conduct. Indeed it was a very marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Enterpriſe in <hi>Eſdras,</hi> and very novel in the World, to make at the ſame time ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men to ſpeak with <hi>Moſes</hi> of a different Character and Stile, and yet every one in a manner uniform, and always like to it ſelf: And on a ſudden to make ſo great and entire a People, (as they were) to believe that thoſe were the antient Books which they had always had in Reverence, and the new which they had ſeen made, as if they had never heard any thing ſpoke of, and that the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the preſent time, as well as that of the time paſt, was utterly defaced. Such are the Prodigies we muſt believe, if we will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe the Miracles of the Almighty, and refuſe to receive the Teſtimony, by which it was evident that they had told ſo great a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they had ſeen them with their Eyes.</p>
               <p>But if that People were returned from <hi>Babylon</hi> unto the Land of their Fathers, ſo new and ſo ignorant that they could ſcarce remember they had ever been, ſo that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Examination they had received all that <hi>Eſdras</hi> was pleaſed to give them: How then is it that we ſee in the Book which
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:56382:213"/> 
                  <hi>Eſdras</hi> wrote,<note place="margin">1 Eſdr. 3.7.9. 2 Eſdr. 5.8.9.12, 13.</note> and in that of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> his Contemporary, whatſoever was there ſaid of the divine Books? With what Front durſt <hi>Eſdras</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſpeak of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> in ſo many places, and that publickly, as of a thing known to all the World, and which all the World had in their Hands? How were all the People ſeen to act natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Obedience to that Law, as having had it always preſent with them? But how was it ſaid at the ſame time, and at the Peoples Return, that all that People admired the Accompliſhment of the Oracle of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> concerning the ſeventy Weeks Captivity? That <hi>Jeremiah</hi> which <hi>Eſdras</hi> had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging with all the other Prophets, how had he on a ſudden found Credit? By what new Artifice were they able to perſwade a whole Nation, even the old Men who had ſeen that Prophet, and had always looked for that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Deliverance which he had foretold them of: <hi>Eſdras</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> could not have written the Hiſtory of their Time; ſome other muſt have done it in their Name, and thoſe who have made all the other Books of the old Teſtament would have been ſo eſteemed by Poſterity, that the other Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifyers would have gained little Credit to their Impoſture.</p>
               <p>No doubt but they would have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of ſo many Extravagancies, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſaying that <hi>Eſdras</hi> had of a ſudden brought to light ſo many Books ſo different one from the other, by the Characters both of Stile and Time, one muſt affirm that he might have inſerted into them the Miracles
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:56382:213"/> and Predictions which made them to paſs for Divine: An Error more groſs ſtill than the former, ſince that thoſe Miracles and thoſe Predictions are ſo interſperſed in all thoſe Books, ſo often inculcated and repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with ſuch different turns, and ſo great a variety of powerful Figures; in a word, they have ſo conſtituted the whole Body of them, that if we have ever but ſo much as opened thoſe holy Books, we muſt ſee, that it was a great deal more eaſy perfectly to make a new Model of them, than to inſert in them thoſe things which the Incredulous are ſo much puzled to find there. And tho' it ſhould be granted them whatſoever they ask, yet the miraculous and divine Parts are ſo much the Foundation of thoſe Books, that they muſt be yet acknowledged what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Averſion any may have to them. And admit that <hi>Eſdras</hi> might have added afterwards the Predictions of thoſe things that had already happened in his time; yet thoſe which were fulfilled ſince, which you have ſeen in ſo great a number, who ſhould ſuperadd them? God, it is poſſible, might have beſtowed on <hi>Eſdras</hi> the gift of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that ſo the Impoſture of <hi>Eſdras</hi> might ſeem the more probable; and they might rather have a falſe one to be a Prophet than <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> or <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> or <hi>Daniel:</hi> Or elſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Age might have had a proſperous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, who might impoſe upon the Faith of a whole Nation; and that new Impoſtors, thro' an admirable Zeal of Religion, might have continually been adding to the divine Books, after that the Canon might have
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:56382:214"/> been cloſed, that they might be ſpread abroad with the <hi>Jews</hi> over all the Earth, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into ſo many ſtrange Languages. Would not this have been (out of eagerneſs of Deſire to eſtabliſh the Religion) the way utterly to deſtroy it? Would a whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo eaſily ſuffer a Change of what they verily believed to be Divine, whether thro' Conviction of Reaſon, or thro' the power of Error. Could any one hope to perſuade Chriſtians, nay or Turks, to add but one ſingle Chapter, either to the Goſpel, or to the Alcoran? But perhaps the <hi>Jews</hi> might be more docile than other People, or not ſo Religious as to preſerve their holy Books? What Monſters of Opinions muſt come into their Minds, to make then willing to ſhake off the Yoke of divine Authority, and not to regulate their Sentiments, no more than their Manners, but by their diſtorted Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?</p>
               <p>Let none ſay that the diſcuſſion of theſe Matters is perplexing and troubleſom: For if it ſhould be ſo, they muſt either lay the Charge of it on the Authority of the Church, and the Tradition of ſo many Ages, or elſe puſh on the Examination to the utmoſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, and never believe they can be rid of it, but ſay they require ſtill more time than will be given to their Salvation. But certainly, not to turn over the Books of both the Teſtaments with an endleſs Labour, we need only read the Book of Pſalms, where are collected ſo many antient Songs of Gods People, to ſee there in the moſt divine Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try that ever was, the immortal Monuments
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:56382:214"/> of the Hiſtory of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of that of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Kings, imprinted by Song and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in Men's Minds. And for the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament: The bare Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo Lively, and Original, ſo ſtrong as to time both of the Affairs and Motions which then were, and in ſhort, of ſo pointing a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; thoſe Epiſtles, I ſay, received by the Churches to which they were addreſſed, and from thence communicated to other Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, will be ſufficient to convince all honeſt Minds, that every thing in the Scriptures which the Apoſtles have left us, is according to the Original.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe do they ſupport one another with an invincible Force. The Acts of the Apoſtles are but a continuation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, their Epiſtles ſuppoſe it neceſſary; but that all may agree together, both the Acts, and the Epiſtles, and Goſpels, do every where own the antient Books of the <hi>Jews.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Apoſtles are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally alledging what <hi>Moſes hath ſaid,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 3.22.7.31, 32, &amp;c. Rom. 10.5.19.</note> what the Prophets have ſaid and writ after <hi>Moſes, Jeſus Chriſt</hi> calls to witneſs <hi>the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>the Prophets, and the Pſalms,</hi> as Witneſſes who all depoſe the ſame Truth. When he hath a mind to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain his Myſteries,<note place="margin">Ibid. 27. John 5.46, 47.</note> 
                  <hi>he begins at</hi> Moſes <hi>and all the Prophets,</hi> and when he tells the <hi>Jews</hi> that <hi>Moſes wrote of him,</hi> he lays down for a Foundation what was moſt certainly believed among them, and brings them back to the very Spring Head of their own Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>But however we will ſee what can be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:56382:215"/> to this ſo acknowledged an Authority, and to the Conſent of ſo many Ages: For ſince in our days Men have been ſo preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and daring as to print in all ſort of Languages Books againſt the Scriptures, we ought not to diſſemble or conceal what they alledge for the decrying its Antiquities. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what ſay they to juſtify the Pentateuch's being ſuppoſititious, and what can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to a Tradition of three thouſand Years ſtanding, upheld by its own Power, and by the courſe of things? Nothing of Conſequence, nothing that is poſitive, nothing that is of weight and ſubſtance. Some little Chicaneries and Quarrels they have at Numbers, Places, and Names; and ſuch Obſervations, that in all other matters are reckoned at moſt but as vain Curioſities un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of reaching the ſtreſs of the Caſe, are here alledge to us by way of Deciſion of an Affair, the moſt ſerious that ever was.</p>
               <p>There are, ſay they, Difficulties in the Hiſtory of the Scripture. No Queſtion to be made on't, which yet there would not be, we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e the Books leſs antient, or had they been ſuppoſititious, and made (as they are ſo bold to ſay) by a cunning and induſtrious Man: If they had not been ſo Religious as to give it us as they found it, but had taken the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to correct it where it did not pleaſe them. There are Difficulties which ariſe by length of time, when places have changed their Name or Condition; when Dates are forgot; when Genealogies are no further known; when there is no remedy for the
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:56382:215"/> Faults which a Copy, tho' never ſo little miſtaken, ſo eaſily introduces in ſuch things, or that matters of Fact, which have ſlipt out of Mens Memories, do leave a Darkneſs upon ſome part of the Hiſtory. But then is this Obſcurity in the Iſſue it ſelf, or in the ſtreſs of this Affair? By no means: All there is followed; and that which is obſcure ſerves only to let us ſee a more venerable Antiquity in thoſe holy Books.</p>
               <p>But there are Alterations in the Text: The ancient Verſions do not agree together; the Hebrew in ſeveral Places is different from it ſelf; and the Text of the <hi>Samaritanes,</hi> beſide the Word which they accuſe them of for changing it expreſly in favor of the Temple of <hi>Gerizim,</hi> differs alſo in many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from that of the <hi>Jews.</hi> And from thence what do they conclude? That the <hi>Jews,</hi> or elſe <hi>Eſdras,</hi> had contrived the Pentateuch at the return of the Captivity? 'Tis juſt the contrary that they ſhould conclude. The Differences of the <hi>Samaritane</hi> ſerve only to confirm what we have already eſtabliſhed, that their Text is independant from that of the <hi>Jews.</hi> So far can we be from imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that thoſe Schiſmaticks took any thing from the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Eſdras,</hi> that we have ſeen exactly to the contrary, that it was in ſpight to the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Eſdras,</hi> and in hatred of both the firſt and the ſecond Temple that they invented their Chimera of <hi>Gerizim.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">V. ſup. <hi>1.</hi> p. <hi>49.</hi> &amp; Seq. <hi>57. 63.</hi>
                  </note> Who therefore does not ſee it plain, that they would rather have accuſed the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhires of the <hi>Jews</hi> than followed them? Thoſe
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:56382:216"/> Rebels who ſcorn'd both <hi>Eſdras</hi> and all the Prophets of the <hi>Jews,</hi> with their Temple, and <hi>Solomon</hi> that built it, as well as <hi>David</hi> who had aſſigned the place of it: what did they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard in their Pentateuch, if not an Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſuperior, not only to that of <hi>Eſdras</hi> and the Prophets, but alſo to that of <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>David;</hi> in a word, the Antiquity of <hi>Moſes,</hi> wherein they both agreed? How indiſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then is <hi>Moſes</hi> his Authority, and that of the Pentateuch, that all the Objections tend only to the affirmation of it.</p>
               <p>But then from whence come thoſe varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Texts and Verſions? From whence indeed, unleſs from the Antiquity of the Book it ſelf which hath gone thro' the Hands of ſo many Tranſcribes for ſo many Ages, that the Language in which it was written is almoſt now worn out? But let us leave theſe vain Diſputes, and in one word pluck up the Difficulty by the Roots. Let any one ſay if it be not evident, that in all the Verſions, and Texts that are, there are ſtill to be found the ſame Laws, the ſame Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, the ſame Predictions, the ſame train of Hiſtory, the ſame Body of Doctrine, and in ſhort the ſame Subſtance. Wherein then after all this do the varieties of Texts hurt? What do we need further than this unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Fond of the ſacred Books, and what can we demand more of the divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? And as for the Verſions, is that a ſign of Forgery or Novelty, that the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Scriptures is ſo antient that the Delicacies of it now are loſt, and we find our ſelves puzled to give it all its Elegance,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:56382:216"/> and to expreſs it in its full ſence and Power of meaning? Is not that rather a Proof of its greater antiquity? and if one would ſtand upon little trifling matters, let any one tell me, if in thoſe ſeveral places wherein they have found themſelves perplexed, any one of them has been ſetled by reaſon or by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture. We have followed the Faith of Examples; and as tradition never permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſound Doctrine to be altered, ſo we thought that the other faults, it there were any, ſerved only to prove that none hath innovated any thing here by the dictate of their own Spirit.</p>
               <p>But now here is at laſt the main ſtreſs of the Objection. Are there not ſome things added in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Text, and how comes it to paſs, that we find his Death at the end of the Book that is attributed to him? What Marvel is this? that thoſe who continued his Hiſtory, ſhould have added his happy end to the reſt of his Actions, and ſo to make one and the ſame Body of the whole? for the other additions let us ſee what they are. Is there any new Law, or any new Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, any Dogma, any Miracle, or any Prediction? they have not ſo much as dreamt of any ſuch thing, there is not the leaſt ſuſpition of it, nor the leaſt Sign: That had been to add to the work of God: the Law had forbid it, and the ſcandal it would have occaſioned, would have been very horrible. What then?<note place="margin">Deut. 4.12.12.5. <hi>ſupra</hi> 2. <hi>part. p.</hi> 220.</note> why they may have continued, perhaps, a Genealogy that he had begun, or poſſibly may have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained the name of a Town changed by time,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:56382:217"/> upon occaſion of the Manna, wherewith the People were fed for forty Years; they may have particularized the time when that Heavenly Nouriſhment ceaſed, and that Fact written ſince in another Book ſhall be made a Remark,<note place="margin">Joſ. 5.12. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. 16.35.</note> upon that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as a manifeſt and publick Fact of which all the People were Witneſſes; and four or five Remarks of this Nature made by <hi>Joſuah,</hi> or <hi>Samuel,</hi> or ſome other Prophet of a like An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity; becauſe they had only regard to notorious Facts, and where there was appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently no difficulty, may have naturally paſt into the Text, and the ſame tradition may have brought them down to us with all the reſt; ſhall preſently all be loſt? Shall <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras</hi> be accuſed, thro' the <hi>Samaritane,</hi> where thoſe Remarks are found? ſhew us, that they have an Antiquity not only above <hi>Eſdras,</hi> but above the Schiſm of the ten Tribes. It matters not, all muſt fall upon <hi>Eſdras.</hi> If thoſe remarks came higher, the Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch would be then more antient than it ought; and we could not pay reverence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to the antiquity of a Book, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Notes whereof would be of ſo great an Age. <hi>Eſdras</hi> therefore may have done all; <hi>Eſdras</hi> may have forgot when he would make <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſpeak, and may have made him to write ſo groſsly as you ſee, what things did happen after his time. Shall a whole work be convicted of forgery by this only place? the Authority of ſo many Ages, and the publick Faith will then be of no further ſtead to him: as if on the contrary we did not ſee that thoſe remarks which they ſo much boaſt
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:56382:217"/> of, are a new proof of Sincerity and Integrity, not only in thoſe that made them, but alſo in thoſe that tranſcribed them. Has there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Judgment paſſed on the authority, I do not ſay of a Divine Book, but of any Book whatſoever, upon ſuch ſlight and trivial rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons? But it ſeems the Scripture is a Book that is an Enemy to Mankind; it would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige Men to ſubmit their Minds to God, to ſuppreſs their diſorderly paſſions: but Man is bent upon his own deſtruction, and let the reward be what it will, he will make himſelf a Sacrifice to Libertiniſm.</p>
               <p>Now can you believe that impiety did not lead them without any neceſſity in the World into all theſe Abſurdities you have ſeen? if againſt the teſtimony of Mankind, and againſt all the Rules of good Sence, it ſtrives to take away from the Pentateuch and the Prophecies, their conſtantly avowed Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, &amp; to diſpute their dates with them. For the dates are all in all as to this matter, for two reaſons; Firſt, becauſe Books that were full of ſo many miraculous deeds, which are ſeen in them, attended with the moſt particular Circumſtances, and advanced not only as publick, but as preſent, if they had been capable of being falſe; would have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried their own Condemnation with them; and inſtead of keeping themſelves up by their own weight, they wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d long ago have fell of themſelves. Secondly, becauſe their dates being once fixed, we can no more efface the Infallible mark of divine Inſpiration, which they bear impreſſed in the great number, and the long courſe of
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:56382:218"/> memorable Predictions which we find them filled withal.</p>
               <p>'Tis to ſhift off theſe Miracles and theſe Predictions that the wicked have run them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into all theſe Abſurdities that have ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized you. But let them not think they ſhall eſcape God. He hath reſerved for his Scriptures ſuch a mark of Divinity, as can never ſuffer any prejudice. 'Tis the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there is between the two Teſtaments. They do not diſpute at leaſt that all the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament was written before the new; here there is no new <hi>Eſdras</hi> which can perſwade the <hi>Jews</hi> to invent, or to falſify their Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in favour of the Chriſtians, whom they Perſecuted. There needs no more. By the relation of the two Teſtaments we prove that both are Divine. They have both the ſame deſign, and the ſame Conſequence. The one prepares the way to that Perfection which the other ſhews openly to all the World; the one lays the Foundation, the other finiſhes the Building; in a word, the one foretells what the other ſhews us accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>Thus all the times are united together, and the eternal deſign of divine Providence is revealed to us. The tradition of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that of the Chriſtians make together but one and the ſame Progreſs of Religion; and the Scriptures of both Teſtaments, are but one and the ſame Body, and one and the ſame Book.</p>
               <p>And becauſe the diſcuſſion of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Predictions, tho' in it ſelf it be full of Light, depends on many Deeds, which all the World cannot equally underſtand; God
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:56382:218"/> hath therefore choſen ſome of them, which he hath made plain to the moſt Ignorant. Thoſe illuſtrious, thoſe bright and conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Facts, of which all the World is a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, are thoſe Facts which I have here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to make your Highneſs compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that is to ſay, the deſolation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Converſion of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> happening together, and both preciſely at the ſame time as the Goſpel was Preached, and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> appeared.</p>
               <p>Theſe three things united in order of time, were yet much more ſo in the order of God's Decrees. You have ſeen them go together in the old Prophecies: but <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the faithful Interpreter of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, and of the Will of his Father, hath ſtill better explained unto us that Bond of Unity in his Goſpel. He does it in the Parable of the Vine-yard ſo familiar in the Prophets. The Father of the Family had planted this Vine, that is to ſay, the true Religion founded upon his Covenant, and had let it out to Husbandmen, that is to ſay, to the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 21.38.</note> And that he might receive the fruits of it, he ſent ſeveral times his Servants who are the Prophets. But theſe unfaithful Husbandmen cauſe ſome to be put to death; his goodneſs leads him to ſend them his Son; and yet him they treat worſe than they did his Servants.</p>
               <p>At laſt he takes away his Vineyard from them, and gives it unto other Husbandmen; he takes away from them the Grace of his Alliance, to beſtow it on the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe three things ought therefore to
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:56382:219"/> concur together, the ſending of the Son of God, the Reprobation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Calling of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> There needs no further a Commentary upon the Parable which the event has it ſelf interpreted.</p>
               <p>You have ſeen the <hi>Jews</hi> confeſs that the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> and the State of their Commonwealth began to fall in the time of <hi>Herod,</hi> and when <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> came into the World. But if the Alterations which they made to the Law of God, have brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them ſo viſible a Diminution of their Power, their laſt Deſolation which yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, muſt be the Puniſhment of a fat greater Crime.</p>
               <p>That Crime is plainly their Ingratitude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who came to inſtruct them, and to make them free. And it is from that time too that an Iron yoke has been over their heads; and they have been long ago cruſhed with it, but that God keeps them to acknowledge one day, and to ſerve that <hi>Meſſiah</hi> whom they have cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p>You then already ſee one averr'd and publick Fact: that is, the total Ruine of the State of the <hi>Jews</hi> at the time of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Converſion of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which was to happen at the ſame time, is no leſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verr'd neither. At the ſame time when the ancient Worſhip was deſtroyed in <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> with the Temple, Idolatry was attacked on all ſides; and the People, who for ſo many thouſands of years had forgot their Creator, were now wakened from ſo long a ſeeming death of ſleep.</p>
               <pb n="425" facs="tcp:56382:219" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>And that all things might accord, the Spiritual Promiſes are diſplayed by the Preaching of the Goſpel, in the Time when the <hi>Jews,</hi> who had only received the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral ones, being openly reproved for their Incredulity, and made Captives over all the face of the Earth, had no longer any worldly Grandeur to expect. Then was Heaven promiſed to thoſe who ſuffered Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution for Righteouſneſs ſake; the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of the Future Life were preached; and the true Bleſſedneſs was ſhown for from that abode where Death reigns, where Sin and all manner of Evils do abound.</p>
               <p>If we do not diſcover here a deſign al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways kept up, and always followed; it we ſee not here one and the ſame order of the Counſels of God, who prepared from the beginning of the World what he finiſhed in the fulneſs of time, and who under different Eſtates, but with a Succeſſion ſtill conſtant, perpetuated to the eyes of all the World that holy Society by whom he would be ſerved; we deſerve to ſee nothing, and to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up to our own hardneſs, as to the moſt juſt and rigorous of all Puniſhments.</p>
               <p>And that this Courſe of God's People might be conſpicuous to the moſt undiſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, God made it ſenſible and palpable by Matters of Fact which none could be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, unleſs he purpoſely ſhut his eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Truth. The <hi>Meſſiah</hi> expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> he came, and he called the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as it had been foretold. The People that owned him as come, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated with thoſe that looked for him,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:56382:220"/> and there was not between them one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Interruption; that People were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed over all the Earth, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ceaſed not to gather together; and that Church which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath built upon a Rock, not all the Powers of Hell have ever been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to overthrow.</p>
               <p>O what Conſolation is this to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God! But what Conviction is here of the Truth, when they ſee that Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Eleventh, who now moſt deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly fills the firſt See of the Church we are continually aſcending without any interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion even to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> made by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the Chief of the Apoſtles: from whence, by running back to the Prieſts that ſerved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, we go up even to <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi> from them to the Patriarchs, and ſo to the beginning of the World! what Courſe, what Tradition, what marvellous Connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Chain is here! If our Minds, which are naturally uncertain, and by their doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs become the Shittlecock of their own Reaſonings, have need in the Queſtions which concern our Salvation, to be fixed and determined by ſome certain Authority, what greater Authority is there than this of the Catholick Church, which reunites in her ſelf all the Authority of paſſed Ages, and the ancient Traditions of Mankind to its firſt Original.</p>
               <p>Thus the Society, which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for during all paſt Ages, at laſt founded upon the Rock, and where St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his Succeſſors were to preſide by his Orders, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified it ſelf by its own Courſe, and bore in
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:56382:220"/> its eternal duration the Character of the Hand of God.</p>
               <p>'Tis alſo this Succeſſion, that no Hereſie, no Sect, no other Society than only the Church of God, was able to give to it ſelf. The falſe Religions could imitate the Church in many things, and eſpecially in ſaying as ſhe did, that God founded them: but that Diſcourſe in their Mouth was only a Diſcourſe in the Air. For if God hath created Mankind, and if in creating him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his own Image, he hath never diſdained to inſtruct him how to ſerve and pleaſe him; Every Sect that doth not ſhew its Succeſſion from the beginning of the World, is not of God.</p>
               <p>Here fall proſtrate at the feet of the Church all the Societies and all the Sects that men have ſet up both within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſtianity. As for Example; The falſe Prophet of the <hi>Arabians</hi> had the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to ſay that he was ſent from God; and after he had deceived the People moſt groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant, he knew how to make his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Diviſions of his Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, to extend into it by force of Arms, a Religion that was wholly Senſual; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has he dared to ſuppoſe that he was the Saviour expected, nor could he in ſhort, give, either to his Perſon or to his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, any real or apparent Unity with paſt Ages. The expedient he found to free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from that was new. For fear leſt they ſhould ſearch into the Scriptures of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians for Teſtimonies of his Miſſion, like to thoſe which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> found in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:56382:221"/> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> he pretended that both the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> had falſified all their Books. His ignorant Followers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved him on his own word ſix hundred years after <hi>Jeſus Christ;</hi> and he declared himſelf, not only without any precedent witneſs, but alſo without any attempt either of ſuppoſing, or of promiſing any one ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Miracle which might authorize his Miſſion, either by himſelf or any of his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers. So likewiſe the <hi>Hereſiarchs,</hi> who have founded new Sects among the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, have had the Art to make the Faith more eaſy by denying the Myſteries which paſſed our Senſes. They were able to dazle men by their Eloquence, and by a ſeeming ſhew of Piety, to move them by their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to ingage them by their Intereſts, to gain 'em over by Novelty and Libertiniſm, either by that of the Mind, or elſe by that of their Senſes: In a word, they could eaſily, either deceive themſelves, or deceive others, for there is nothing more Humane; but beſides that they could never boaſt they had done any Miracle in Publick, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their Religion to poſitive Facts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of their Followers were Witneſſes, there was always a moſt unhappy miſchief attended them, which they could never conceal, and that was their Novelty. It will always be viſible to the eyes of the whole World, that they and their Sect which they have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, will be detached from that great Body, and from that ancient Church which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> has founded, where St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his Succeſſors have kept the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:56382:221"/> in which all Sects have found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves eſtabliſhed. The moment of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration will be always ſo apparent, that the Hereticks themſelves can never be able to deny it, and they will never dare ſo much as to attempt to make themſelves to come from the Source by an uninterrupted Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. This is the inevitable weakneſs of all the Sects which Mankind has ſet up. None can change the Ages paſt, nor give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Predeceſſors, nor ever make them to be found in poſſeſſion. The only Catholick Church fills up all precedent Ages, by a Courſe of Succeſſion that can never be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted with her. The Law came before the Goſpel; the Succeſſion of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs makes but one and the ſame with that of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> to be looked for, to come, to be acknowledged by a Poſterity which is to laſt as long as the World; this is the Character of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> in whom we believe. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the ſame yeſterday,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 13.8.</note> 
                  <hi>and to day, and for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus beſides the advantage which the Church of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath, of being alone founded on miraculous and divine Facts which they have written for all to ſee, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any fear of being falſified as to the time in which they happened; there is likewiſe in favour of thoſe who lived not in thoſe Times, one Miracle that always is ſubſiſting, which confirms the truth of all the reſt; that is the Courſe of Religion which hath been always victorious over the Errors that have crept in, which indeavour to deſtroy it. You may add to this alſo another Chain, and
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:56382:222"/> that is the viſible uninterruptedneſs of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Puniſhment upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> who have not yet received <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſo long ago promiſed to their Fathers.</p>
               <p>They nevertheleſs expect him ſtill; and this their expectation, which is always fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, is one part of their Puniſhment. They expect him, and diſcover in their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation that he hath always been expected. Condemned therefore by their own Books, they confirm the truth of Religion; they, as I may ſay, do carry all the Courſe of it written on their Foreheads: and at one view we ſee what they have been, why they are as we ſee them, and for what they are reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>Thus four or five Authentick Facts, and thoſe more clear than the light of the Sun, do diſcover our Religion to be as old as the World. And conſequently they diſcover that it hath no other Author than He who made the World, who holding all things in the hollow of his Hand, was able by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone both to begin and carry on a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign wherein all Ages are comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>We need therefore no longer wonder, as we commonly do, why God propoſes to us to believe ſo many things ſo worthy of him, and yet at the ſame time ſo impenetrable to Humane Underſtanding. But we ſhould rather wonder, that he having eſtabliſhed the Faith upon ſo firm and manifeſt an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, there ſhould yet be any in the World blind and incredulous.</p>
               <p>Our diſorderly Paſſions, our being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:56382:222" rendition="simple:additions"/> to our Senſes, and our incurable Pride are the cauſe of it. We chooſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to venture all, than to put a conſtraint upon our ſelves; we chooſe rather to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in our Ignorance, than to confeſs it, and are pleaſed rather with a vain Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and indulging our unruly Spirits in the liberty of thinking whatſoever delights 'em, than to yield to the yoke of Divine Authority.</p>
               <p>From thence it is that there are ſo many Unbelievers, and God ſuffers it to be ſo for the inſtruction of his Children. Unleſs we had the Blind, the Savage, and the Infidel, and that in the very Boſom too of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we ſhould not be ſenſible enough of the Corruption of our Nature, nor of that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſs of Miſery from whence <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath delivered us. If his holy Truth was not contradicted, we ſhould not ſee the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle which hath conſtantly carried it through ſo many Contradictions, and we ſhould forget at laſt that we are ſaved by Grace. Now the Incredulity of the one does humble the reſt; and thoſe Rebels that oppoſe God's Decrees, make that Power conſpicuous by which indepently from all things elſe, he accompliſhes the Promiſes he hath made to his Church.</p>
               <p>What therefore is it that we look for now to make us humble and ſubmiſs? do we look that God ſhould ſtill work new Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; that he ſhould make them uſeleſs by his continuing of them, that he ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom our eyes to them as he does to the Courſe of the Sun, and to all the other
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:56382:223"/> Marvels of Nature? or elſe do we ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that the wicked and the opinionative man ſhould be ſilent? that good and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men and diſſolute Libertines ſhould bear an equal Teſtimony to the Truth? that all the World by one common conſent ſhould prefer it to their Paſſions; and that falſe Knowledge, which only the Novelty of it cauſes to be admired, ſhould ceaſe its u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual way of ſurpriſing men? Is it not enough that we ſee it is impoſſible for men to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with Religion, but they muſt at the ſame time ſhew by prodigious wandrings, that their Senſes are perverted, and that they only defend themſelves either by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption or ignorance? Cannot the Church, which hath been victorious both over A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Errours, I ſay, cannot that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in our Minds thoſe weak and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Reaſonings which are oppoſed to her; and cannot the Divine Promiſes, which we ſee every day are accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, elevate and raiſe us above our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes?</p>
               <p>Now let us not ſay that theſe Promiſes are ſtill kept in ſuſpence, and as they are to hold out to the end of the World, ſo it will not be until the end of the World, that we can boaſt we have ſeen the accompliſhment of them. For on the contrary, that which is already paſt aſſures us of the future: ſo many ancient Predictions ſo viſibly fulfilled, make us ſatisfied that there will be nothing but what ſhall be accompliſhed: and that the Church, againſt which, according as the
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:56382:223" rendition="simple:additions"/> Son of God hath promiſed us, even the Gates of Hell ſhall never prevail, will be always ſubſiſting until the conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things, for that <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> who is true in all, hath preſcribed no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bounds to its duration.</p>
               <p>The ſame Promiſes do likewiſe aſſure us of a future Life. God, who hath ſhewn himſelf ſo faithful, in accompliſhing what reſpects the preſent Age, will be no leſs faithful in accompliſhing that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the Future, of which all that we ſee is but a preparation, and the Church will be always unſhaken and invincible on the Earth, until that her Children being gathered together, ſhe be entirely conveyed to her, which is her only true Manſion.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe who ſhall be excluded from that heavenly City, an eternal Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance is reſerved for them; and after they have loſt by their Sin and Folly a bleſſed Eternity, there will be left for them no other place but a Hell of Eternal woe and miſery.</p>
               <p>Thus the Decrees of God are to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate by an immutable ſtate; his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and his Threatnings are equally certain; and what he executes in time, aſſures us of what he hath commanded us either to expect or fear in Eternity.</p>
               <p>You now ſee what may be learned from the continual progreſs of Religion as it is in ſhort preſented to your Eyes. By time it conducts you to Eternity. You ſee a conſtant order in all God's
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:56382:224"/> Decrees, and a viſible Mark of his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the perpetual duration of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. You cannot but confeſs that the Church hath a Branch always ſubſiſting, which cannot be ſeparated from it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſtroying it, and that thoſe, who, being united to this Root, do perform ſuch Works as are worthy of their Faith, and ſecure to themſelves eternal Life.</p>
               <p>Your Highneſs is therefore to ſtudy, but to ſtudy with attention this uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Courſe of the Church, which ſo clearly aſſures to you all the Promiſes of God. Whatſoever breaks this Chain, whatſoever goes out of this Courſe, wha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tſoever advances it ſelf, and does not come by virtue of the Promiſes made to the Church from the beginning of the World, you are to have in horrour. Imploy all your power to recall into this Unity whatſoever is ſtragled out of the way of it, and to make it hearken to the Church by which the Holy Spirit of God pronounces its Oracles.</p>
               <p>The Glory of your Anceſtors is not only that they never forſook it, but that they always ſupported it; and thereby deſerved to be called the Eldeſt Sons, which is certainly the moſt glorious of all their Titles.</p>
               <p>'Tis needleſs for me to mention to you <hi>Clovis, Charlemaine,</hi> or St. <hi>Louis.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider only the time you live in, and from what Father God hath given you your Birth. A King ſo great in every thing, yet is more to be diſtinguiſhed by
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:56382:224"/> his Faith than by all his other admirable Qualities. He protects Religion not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly within, but out of his Kingdom, and even to the laſt Extremities of the World. His Laws are one of the firmeſt Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers of the Church. His Authority re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered as much by the Merit of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as by the Majeſty of his Scepter, never ſupports it ſelf ſo well as when it defends the Cauſe of God. We hear no more Blaſphemies; Impiety trembles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: this is the King taken notice of by <hi>Solomon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 20.26.</note> that <hi>in his Wiſdom ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth the Wicked, and bringeth the Wheel over them.</hi> If he attacks Hereſie by ſuch means, and that more too than ever did any of his Predeceſſors, it is not that he is fearful for his Throne; for all lyes quiet at his Feet, and his Arms are dreaded over all the Earth; but it is becauſe he loves his People, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſible that he is advanced by the Hand of God to a Power that nothing can equal in the Univerſe, he knoweth not what better uſe to make of it, but to imploy it to the Healing of the Wounds of the Church.</p>
               <p>May your Highneſs imitate ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous an Example, and leave it to your Deſcendant Poſterity. Recommend to them the Churches Care to be ſure, more than that Great Empire which your Anceſtors have governed for ſo many Ages. May your Illuſtrious Houſe, the firſt in Dignity to any in the

               <p>Firſt, Thoſe Empires have for the moſt part a neceſſary Connexion to the Hiſtory of the People of God. God was ſerved by the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> and the <hi>Babylonians</hi> to chaſtiſe that People; by the <hi>Perſians,</hi> to re-eſtabliſh them; by <hi>Alexander</hi> and his firſt Succeſſors, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them; by <hi>Antiochus</hi> the Illuſtrious and his Succeſſors, to exerciſe them; by the <hi>Romans,</hi> to maintain their Liberty againſt

If the ſame <hi>Roman</hi> Empire perſecuted for two hundred Years this new People which riſe up on all ſides within its Walls, that Perſecution hath confirmed the Chriſtian Church, and hath made its Glory the more bright and conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous by its Faith and Patience. At laſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire yielded; and having found ſomething more invincible than it, it quietly received into its Boſom that Church againſt which it had made ſo long and ſo cruel a War of Reſiſtance. The Emperors have laid out all their Power to make the Church be obeyed, and <hi>Rome</hi> hath been the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Empire that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> would extend o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the Earth.</p>
               <p>When the time was come that the <hi>Roman</hi> Power was to fall, and that that great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire had vainly promiſed an Eternity to it
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:56382:226" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſelf, was to undergo the Fate of all others, <hi>Rome</hi> became the Prey of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> yet by its Religion kept up its antient Majeſty. The Nations that invaded the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, by little and little learnt their Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Piety, which tempered their Barbariſme; and their Kings, in placing themſelves each in their Nation in the room of Emperors, found not any of their Titles more glorious than that of being Protectors of the Church.</p>
               <p>But here I muſt diſcover to you the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Judgments of God upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and even upon <hi>Rome</hi> herſelf: A My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery which the Holy Ghoſt revealed to St. <hi>John,</hi> and which that great Man, Apoſtle, Evangeliſt, and Prophet, hath explained in the Revelations. <hi>Rome</hi> that was grown old in the Worſhip of Idols, found it extreamly difficult to get rid of it even under Chriſtian Emperors; and the Senate counted it an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to defend the Gods of <hi>Romulus,</hi> to whom they attributed all the Victories of the old Common-Wealth.</p>

Thus that Company which was made up of the chiefeſt Grandees the Empire had, and an immenſe number of People, in which were well near all the moſt famous and ſignalized Perſons of <hi>Rome,</hi> could not be drawn from their Errors, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the preaching of the Goſpel, nor by ſo plain and viſible an accompliſhment of
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:56382:227" rendition="simple:additions"/> the antient Prophecies, nor by the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of almoſt all the reſt of the Empire, nor to conclude, by that of the Princes all whoſe Decrees were in favor of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. On the contrary, they continued moſt opprobriouſly to charge the Church of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> which they accuſed alſo, after the Example of their Fore-fathers, of all the Miſchiefs and Calamities of the Empire, always ready to renew the antient Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if they had not been ſuppreſſed by the Emperors. Things were in this Condition at the fourth Age of the Church, and a hundred Years after <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> when God at laſt called again to mind the many bloody Decrees of the Senate againſt his faithful People, and at the ſame time rememb'red the furious Outcries of all the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe greedineſs after Chriſtian Blood had ſo often made the Amphitheatres to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound. He therefore delivered to the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> that City,<note place="margin">Apocalypſ. 17.6.</note> 
                  <hi>drunken with the Blood of the Saints, and with the Blood of</hi> Jeſus, as St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks. God renewed upon her the terrible Chaſtiſements he had exerciſed upon <hi>Babylon;</hi> ſo that <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf was called by that Name. That new <hi>Babylon,</hi> the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of the old, as ſhe was fleſhed and ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with her Victories, triumphing in her Delicacies and her Riches, polluted with her Idolatries, and a perſecutor of the People of God, fell alſo as ſhe did, and her Fall was great,<note place="margin">Revelat. 17.18.</note> as St. <hi>John</hi> ſings her Ruine. The Glory of her Conqueſts, which ſhe attributed to her Gods, is taken away from her: She is made a Prey to the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> taken three
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:56382:227"/> or four times, pillaged, ſack'd, deſtroyed. The Sword of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> only ſpares the Chriſtians. Another <hi>Rome</hi> entirely Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ariſes out of the Aſhes of that former, and it was only after the Inundation of the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> that the Victory of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was perfectly obtained over the <hi>Roman</hi> Gods which were ſeen then not only deſtroyed, but quite forgotten.</p>
               <p>Thus the Empires of the world have mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to Religion, and the Preſervation of the People of God? Wherefore this ſame God who hath cauſed his Prophets to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel the ſeveral Eſtates of his People, hath alſo cauſed them to foretel the Succeſſion of the Empires. You have ſeen the places where <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> hath been pointed out as he that was to come and puniſh the proud People, and particularly the <hi>Jews</hi> ſo ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful againſt their Author.

                  </gap>n, as he that was to ſet up again the People of God, and to puniſh the Pride of <hi>Babylon.</hi> The Ruine of <hi>Nineveh</hi> was as clearly foretold. <hi>Daniel,</hi> in his admirable Viſions, hath cauſed to go before your Eyes in a moment the Empire of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> that of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and the <hi>Grecians.</hi> The Blaſphemies and the Cruelties of <hi>Antiochus</hi> the Illuſtrious were there foretold, as well as the miraculous Victories of the People of God over ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a Perſecutor. We ſee there thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Empires to fall one after another; and the new Empire which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was to ſet up, is there ſo expreſly deſcribed by its
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:56382:228"/> proper Characters, that there is no way to miſtake it. 'Tis the Empire of the Saints of the moſt high; the Empire of the Son of Man; an Empire which was to ſubſiſt in the midſt of the Ruine of all the reſt, and to which alone Eternity is promiſed.</p>
               <p>The Judgments of God upon the greateſt of all the Empires of this World, that is to lay, upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, have not been kept hid from us. You have juſt now had it from the mouth of St. <hi>John. Rome</hi> her ſelf hath felt the Hand of God, and hath been like others an Example of his Juſtice. But its fate was happier yet than that of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; for being purged by her Puniſhments from the remaining dreggs of Idolatry, ſhe now no longer ſubſiſts but by that Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which ſhe declares to all the World.</p>
               <p>Thus have all the great Empires which we have ſeen upon the Earth, concured by ſeveral ways and means to the weal of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the glory of God, as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath declared it by his Prophets.</p>
               <p>When you read ſo often in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings that Kings in troops ſhall enter into the Church, and be the Protectors and Nurſing Fathers of it, thoſe words preſently put into your mind the Emperours, and other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes: and as the Kings your Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, have more than any other, ſignalized themſelves in protecting and enlarging the Church of God, I ſhall not be afraid to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, that it is they, who of all the Kings are moſt clearly foretold in thoſe emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently remarkable Prophecies.</p>
               <pb n="443" facs="tcp:56382:228"/>
               <p>God therefore, who was reſolved to make uſe of divers Empires, either to chaſtiſe, or exerciſe, or to enlarge or protect his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, willing to make himſelf known for the Author of ſo admirable a Councel, revealed the Secret of it to his Prophets, and hath cauſed them to foretel what he had reſolved to execute. Wherefore as the Empires began the order of Gods Decrees on the People whom he had choſen, ſo the fortune of thoſe Empires were found declared by the ſame Oracles of the Holy Ghoſt which foretold the Succeſſion of the faithful People.</p>
               <p>The more you accuſtome your ſelf to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low great things, and to recal them to their Principles, the more will you ſtand in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of thoſe Councels of Providence. It behoves you to take the Ideas of them betimes, which will clear up every day more and more in your Minds, and you will be the better able to refer humane things to the order of that eternal Wiſdom on which they depend.</p>
               <p>God doth not every day declare his Will by his Prophets concerning Kings and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, that he ſets up or deſtroys. But having done it ſo often, as to thoſe Empires whereof we have been ſpeaking, he ſhews us by thoſe famous Examples what he does in all others, and he teaches Kings theſe two fundamental Truths: Firſt, That it is he who forms Kingdoms to give them to whom he pleaſeth: And Secondly, That he knoweth how to make them ſerve, in the time and order which he hath decreed, to the Deſigns he hath on his People,</p>
               <pb n="444" facs="tcp:56382:229"/>
               <p>This, may it pleaſe your Highneſs, ought to keep all Princes in an intire Dependance, and to make them always careful of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of God, that ſo they may lend their Hand to what he purpoſes for his own Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon all Occaſions that he offers them.</p>
               <p>But this Succeſſion of Empires, if we will conſider it more humanly, hath very great Advantages, eſpecially for Princes, ſeeing that Arrogance, the ordinary Companion of ſo exalted a Condition, is ſo very much quelled by ſuch a Spectacle. For if Men learn to moderate themſelves by ſeeing Kings die, how much more will they be ſtruck by ſeeing Kingdoms themſelves to periſh; and from whence can they receive a more plain Leſſon of the Vanity of humane Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</p>
               <p>Thus when you behold as in an inſtant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Eyes, the Death and Downfal, I do not ſay, of Kings and Emperors, but of thoſe mighty Empires that have made the whole Univerſe to tremble; when you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold both the antient and the new <hi>Aſſyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> the <hi>Medes,</hi> the <hi>Perſians,</hi> the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and the <hi>Romans,</hi> all before you ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, and all to fall, as I may ſay, one upon another; this dreadfull Deſtruction pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently makes you ſenſible that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſolid among Men, and that Inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Agitation is the proper Partage and Portion of humane things.</p>
               <pb n="445" facs="tcp:56382:229" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>BUT that which will render to your Highneſs this Spectacle both more advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious a more agreeable,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>II.</hi> The Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Empires have particular Cauſes which Princes ought to ſtudy.</note> will be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection you ſhall make not only on the Riſe and Fall of Empires, but alſo on the Cauſes of their Progreſs, and on thoſe of their Ruine.</p>
               <p>For, Sir, that ſame God who hath made the Chain of the Univerſe, and who, as he is Almighty by himſelf, hath reſolved, for the eſtabliſhing of Order, that the Parts of ſo great an All ſhould depend one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that ſame God hath alſo decreed that the courſe of humane things ſhould have its Iſſues and its Proportions; I mean, that Men and Nations have had Qualities commenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to the Advancements to which they have been deſigned; and that expecting ſome certain extraordinary Strokes, wherein God hath been willing to manifeſt his own Hand in particular, there are no very great Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges happen but what may deduce their Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from precedent Ages.</p>
               <p>And as in all Affairs there is that which prepares them, that which determines to undertake them, and laſtly, that which makes them have Succeſs: So the true Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Hiſtory is to obſerve in every time thoſe ſecret Diſpoſitions which have prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and made way for great Changes, and the important Conjunctures which have brought them to paſs.</p>
               <p>Indeed, it is not ſufficient to look only juſt before one, that is to ſay, to conſider thoſe great Events which all on a ſudden do
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:56382:230" rendition="simple:additions"/> decide the fortune of Empires. He that would reach to the Bottom of humane things, ought to take them at their firſt Head and Spring; and he muſt obſerve the Inclinations, and the Tempers; or, to ſpeak all in one word, the Character, as well of the People Governing in general, as of the Princes in particular, and in a word, of all extraordinary Men, who by the Importance of the Part they have had in the World, have contributed, either well or ill, to the change of States, and to the publick For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
               <p>I have endeavoured to prepare you to theſe neceſſary Reflections in the firſt part of this Diſcourſe; you may be able there to obſerve the Genius of the People, and that of thoſe great Men that lead them. The Events that have ſucceeded in the ſequel have been ſhewn; and that I might keep your Mind intent upon the Chain of the great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the World, which principally I would have you to underſtand, I have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely omitted ſeveral particular Facts, whoſe Conſequences have not been ſo conſiderable. But becauſe by our fixing ſo much upon the End propoſed, we have too ſlightly paſt over ſeveral things, ever to be able to make the juſt Reflections on them they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, you may be pleaſed now to ſet your ſelf about it with a more particular attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to accuſtome your Mind to ſeek out the Effects in their moſt diſtant and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Cauſes.</p>
               <p>Thereby, Sir, you will learn what is ſo neceſſary to be known, that although, if we
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:56382:230" rendition="simple:additions"/> only have regard to particular accidents, Fortune ſeems alone to decide the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the ruine of Empires; yet perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to underſtand the whole, it happens juſt as it does at Play, where the moſt agile and dextrous carry it againſt the ſtronger Hand.</p>
               <p>In fine, in this tragical and bloody game, where People are in diſpute about Empire and Power, he that hath forecaſted at the greateſt diſtance, that hath moſt applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that hath continued longeſt in the moſt difficult Labours, and in a word, he that hath the greateſt Skill, either in puſhing on, or in improving a begun Encounter, at laſt hath had the advantage, and hath made even fortune her ſelf aſſiſting to his Deſigns.</p>
               <p>Therefore it behooves you not to be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of inquiring into the cauſes of great Changes, ſince that nothing can be more ſerviceable to inſtruct you than that; but eſpecially ſeek till you find them in the Event of great Empires, where the greatneſs of the Accidents makes them more plain and palpable.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not here reckon among the great Empires that of <hi>Bacchus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">III. <hi>The</hi> Scythians, <hi>the</hi> Ethiopians, <hi>and</hi> Egyptians.</note> nor that of <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> thoſe famous Conquerors of the <hi>Indies</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> Their Hiſtories have nothing certain, their Conqueſts have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of connection in them: we will leave them to be celebrated by the Poets, who have made them the greateſt Subject of their Fables.</p>
               <p>Neither ſhall I ſpeak any more of the

               <p>However thoſe People of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> were not ſo juſt as they proudly pretended to be, nor ſo ſhut up within their own Country. Their Neighbours, the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times felt their Power. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of continuedneſs in the Councils of thoſe ſavage and ill-cultivated Nations: If Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did at any time begin in them any good Sentiments, ſhe never finiſhed them. So that we find but very little to be learnt or imitated from them. Therefore we will ſpeak no more of them, but now come to a more poliſhed People.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Egyptians</hi> are the firſt from whom we have learnt any Rules of Government. This being a grave and ſerious Nation, firſt underſtood the true end of Polity, which is to render Life commodious, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple happy. The temperature of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try being always uniform, made their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments more ſolid and conſtant. As Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is the Foundation of all Society, ſo they carefully cultivated and improved it. Their chief Vertue was Gratitude. The Honour that was given to them for
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:56382:232" rendition="simple:additions"/> being the moſt generous and grateful,<note place="margin">Diod. lib. 1. Sect. 2.</note> ſhews they were likewiſe the moſt ſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Kindneſſes are the Bond both of publick and private Concord. He that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges Favours, loves to Beſtow them; and in baniſhing Ingratitude, the pleaſure of doing Good remains ſo pure, that there is no way for one to be inſenſible of it. Their Laws were Simple, full of Equity, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to unite Citizens to one another. He who being able to reſcue a man aſſaulted, did not do it, was puniſhed with as ſevere a Death as the Aſſaſſin himſelf.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> If we could not help the unfortunate, at leaſt we ought to impeach the Author of the Violence, and there were puniſhments eſtabliſhed on purpoſe for thoſe that were failing in this duty. Thus were the Citizens a Guard each to other, and all the Body of the State was joyned againſt the wicked doer. It was not permitted for any one to be unprofitable to the State; The Law aſſigned to every one their Buſineſs, which was perpetuated from Father to Son.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> They were not to have two, nor could they change their Profeſſion; but then all Profeſſions were honoured. But it was neceſſary there ſhould be ſome, both Employments and Perſons, more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable than others, as it is but fit that Eyes ſhould be in the Body. Their Luſter will not make the Feet and lower Parts to be ever the leſs deſpiſed. So among the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the Prieſts and the Soldiers had their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Marks of Honour: but all the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, even to the leaſt, were had in eſteem: and it was believed a Criminal Matter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:56382:233"/> and ſcorn the Citizens, whoſe Labours, whatſoever they were, contributed to the weal Publick. By this means all Arts came to their Perfection: the Honour which che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed them was in every thing concerned: they made greater Improvements in what they had always ſeen done, and to what in particular they had been brought up from their very Infancy.</p>
               <p>But there was one Occupation which all men were to be concerned in; and that was the ſtudy of Laws and Wiſdom. Ignorance of the Religion and Polity of ones Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was no where excuſable in any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now every Profeſſion had its Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton to which it was particularly aſſigned.</p>
               <p>There fell out no Inconvenience by it in a Country whoſe Extent was not very great, and in ſo curious and exact an order. Thoſe that had a mind to be Idle, knew not where to hide themſelves.</p>
               <p>Amidſt theſe many good Laws, that which was the beſt of 'em, was, that all People were brought up to obſerve them.<note place="margin">Hierod. l. <hi>2.</hi> Diod. l. <hi>1. §. 2.</hi> Plat. delegib. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> A new Cuſtom was a Prodigy in <hi>Egypt:</hi> Every one did there always the ſame; and the punctual Care they had to obſerve ſmall things, maintained the great. So that never was there any People that had longer preſerved their Cuſtoms and Laws. The order of the Judgments contributed to the upholding of that <hi>Genius.</hi> Thirty judges were choſen out of the principal Cities to make up that Commiſſion to Judge the whole Kingdom. They were accuſtomed to ſee in thoſe high places only the moſt
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:56382:233"/> grave men of their Country, and ſuch as were of the cleareſt Integrity. The Prince gave them certain Salaries, that ſo they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freed from Domeſtick Entanglements, might beſtow the groſs of their time in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Laws to be the better obſerved. They received no Advantage by Suits of Law, for as yet they had never thought of making a Trade of Juſtice. To avoid ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes, the matters were debated in thoſe Aſſembly by Arguments in writing. They were afraid there of falſe Eloquence, which might dazle the Underſtanding, and ſtir up the Paſſions. Truth could not be told there in too plain a manner. The Preſident of the Senate wore a Collar of Gold and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, from whence hung a Figure without any Eyes, which they called <hi>Truth.</hi> When he took it, that was the Signal to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the Court. He bowed it to the Party that was to gain his Cauſe, and that was the form of pronouncing the Sentences. One of the braveſt Artifices of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to make their ancient Maxims be preſerved, was to inveſt them with certain Ceremonies that imprinted them in their Minds. Theſe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies were obſerved with reflection; and the ſerious Humour of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did not ſuffer that they ſhould be turned into ſimple <hi>Formula's.</hi> Thoſe who had no Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, but their Lives were Innocent, might avoid the Examen of that ſevere Tribunal. But they had in <hi>Egypt</hi> one kind of Judgment which was very extraordinary, which none eſcaped. It was a Conſolation at the time of Death of leaving their Names in eſteem
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:56382:234"/> among all men, and of all humane goods it is the only one that Death cannot raviſh from us. But it was not ſuffered in <hi>Egypt</hi> to commend all the Dead indifferently: That was an Honour to be had by a Publick Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As ſoon as a man was dead, they brought him unto Judgment. The publick Accuſer was heard. If he proved that the Conduct of the Deceaſed had been bad, then the Memory of him was condemned, and he was deprived of Sepulture. The People admired the power of their Laws, which reached them even after death, and every one being touched by the Example, was afraid to diſhonour his Memory and his Family. But if the Defunct was not convicted of any Crime, then he had an honourable Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: they made his Panegyrick, but they medled not at all with his Birth. All <hi>Egypt</hi> was noble, and beſide they received no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commendations than what they had got by their own Merit.</p>
               <p>Every one knows how curious the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were in preſerving dead Bodies. Their <hi>Mummies</hi> are to be ſeen at this day. Thus their Gratitude to their Kindred was Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal: Children by ſeeing the Bodies of their Anceſtors, called to mind their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which the Publick had paid ſuch Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments to, and they were incited to love thoſe Laws which had ſo recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to them.</p>
               <p>To prevent Borrowing, which was the Parent of Idleneſs, Frauds and Branglings, the Decree of King <hi>Aſychis</hi> did not ſuffer any to borrow,<note place="margin">Herod. lib. <hi>2.</hi> Diod. <hi>1.</hi> Sect.</note> but upon condition that he
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:56382:234" rendition="simple:additions"/> pledged the Body of his Father to him of whom he borrowed. And it was both an Impiety and an Infamy together, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem, as ſoon as ever one could, ſo precious a Pledge; and he that dyed before he had acquitted himſelf of that duty, was denied Burial.</p>
               <p>The Kingdom was Hereditary; but the Kings were obliged more than all others, to live according to theſe Laws.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Some there were more particular that a King had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, and which made one part of the Sacred Books. Not that they had diſputed any thing againſt Kings, or that any one had a right to conſtrain them; but on the contrary, they were looked upon as Gods, but an ancient Cuſtom had regulated them all, and they reſolved to live no otherwiſe than their Anceſtors. So that they patiently ſuffered themſelves, not only to be regulated in their manner of Victuals and Drink (for it was an ordinary thing in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where all People were ſober, and where the Air of the Country was a friend to Frugality) but they were content that their very hours ſhould be ſet them. In waking at break of day.<note place="margin">

As ſoon as they were dreſt, they went to Sacrifice in the Temple. There, being incompaſſed by all their Court, and the Victimes at the Altar, they aſſiſted at a Prayer full of Inſtructions, where the Chief Prieſt prayed to the Gods to confer on the
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:56382:235"/> Prince all Royal Vertues, ſo that he might be religious to the Gods, placid towards Men, moderate, juſt, magnanimous, ſincere, and far from falſhood, liberal, a Maſter of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, puniſhing below, but rewarding above deſert. The Chief Prieſt afterwards ſpake of the faults that Kings might commit, but he always ſuppoſed they fell into them by ſurprize, or ignorance, charging with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations the Miniſters that gave them evil Counſels, and concealed the Truth from them. This was the manner of inſtructing Kings.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> They thought Reproaches did on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſower their Spirits, and that the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual way of inſpiring Vertue into them, was to point out to them their Duty in Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes conformable to the Laws, and gravely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered before their Gods. After Prayer and Sacrifice, they read to the King in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Books, the Counſels and the Actions of great Men, that ſo he might govern his Kingdom by their Maxims, and maintain the Laws which had made his Predeceſſors happy as well as their Subjects.</p>
               <p>That which ſhews that theſe Remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were made and hearkened to ſeriouſly, was that they had their effect.

               <p>This Cuſtom of judging Kings after their Death ſeemed ſo holy to the People of God, that they have always practiſed it. We read in the Scriptures that wicked Kings have been deprived of the Burial of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors,<note place="margin">

The <hi>Egyptians</hi> themſelves likewiſe give ſo great an Antiquity to <hi>Oſiris,</hi> that it is plainly ſeen they have confounded his time with that of the beginning of the World, and they would fain attribute ſome things to him whoſe Original was long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all times known in their Hiſtory.

                  </note> For as their Country was united, and their Heaven always clear and uncloudy, they were the firſt that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Courſe of the Stars: and they were the firſt alſo that regulated the year.

               <p>One thing which made the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on the Minds of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> was the eſteem and love of their Country.

                  </note> It was the Mother of both Men and Beaſts, which the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> watered with the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> had brought forth, whilſt all Nature beſides was barren. The Prieſts that compoſed the Hiſtory of <hi>Egypt</hi> out of that vaſt continuance of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which they only filled with the Fables

But their real Hiſtory was circumſcribed within reaſonable Bounds, and yet they found ſo much as to loſe themſelves in an infinite Abyſs of Time which ſeemed to bring them near to Eternity.</p>
               <p>But yet their love to their Country had more ſolid Foundations. <hi>Egypt</hi> was in fine the moſt beautiful Country in the World, the moſt plentiful by Nature, the beſt cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated by Art, the richeſt, the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, and the moſt adorned by the care and magnificence of her Kings.</p>
               <p>There was nothing but what was very great in their Deſigns and in their Work. What they made in <hi>Nilus</hi> is incredible. It rained very ſeldom in <hi>Egypt:</hi> but that River which watered it all by its orderly Flowings, brought to it the Rains and the Snows of other Countreys.

                  <hi>Egypt</hi> was Traverſed with an infinite number of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of an incredible length and largeneſs. <hi>Nilus</hi> carried fruitfulneſs every where with its wholſom Waters, united Towns to one another, and the great Sea to the red Sea, kept up Commerce both within and our of the Kingdom, and fortified it againſt the Enemy: ſo that it was altogether both the Nouriſher and the Defender of <hi>Egypt.</hi> The Fields were ſwallowed up with it; but the Towns that were ſet above by vaſt pains and labour, and raiſed as Iſlands in the midſt of the Waters, joyful at ſuch their advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:56382:237"/> they beheld all the Plain overflown; and at the ſame time made fruitful by the <hi>Nile.</hi> When it ſwelled it ſelf above Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, there were great Lakes cut hollow by the Kings that opened their Boſoms to the poured our Waters. They have their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges prepared; great Sluces opened or ſhut them up as there was occaſion; and the Waters having thus their retreat, tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried no longer on the Earth than juſt what was neceſſary to Marle, and make 'em fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile.</p>
               <p>Such was the uſe of this great Lake, which was called the Lake of <hi>Myris,</hi> or of <hi>Moeris:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Herod. <hi>10.</hi> Diod. ibid.</note> It was the name of the King that had cauſed it to be made. One would be aſtoniſhed to read what notwithſtanding is very certain, that the Compaſs of it round, was about a hundred and fourſcore of our Leagues. That too much of the good Land might not be loſt by the cutting it hollow, they extended it chiefly towards the Coaſt of <hi>Libya.</hi> The Fiſhery was worth to the King vaſt Sums of Money; and ſo when the Land did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any thing it yielded Treaſures by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing covered with the Waters. Two Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mids, each of which bore upon a Throne two <hi>Coloſſus</hi>-like Statues, the one of <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> the other of his Wife, were raiſed three hundred Foot high in the midſt of the Lake, and were of an equal Depth under the Water: So that they ſhewed that they were built before the Hollow was filled, and that a Lake of that vaſt Extent was made by Man's Hand under one ſingle Prince.</p>

               <p>Let there be, if you pleaſe, a little ſtretch in that Number, yet it is moſt certain that her People were not to be numbered.

               <p>If our Travellers had got ſo far as where this City was built, they would, no doubt, have yet found ſomething incomparable in her Ruines: For the Works of the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were made to hold out againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of time.

What Magnificence and Extent was there! As yet, thoſe that have deſcribed to us this prodigious Building, have not had time of going round it; nay, and are not very ſure they have ſeen above half of it, but however, all they have ſeen was very ſurprizing. A Hall, which ſeems to be placed in the middle of that ſtately Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, was ſupported by ſix ſcore Pillars of thirty Foot in Compaſs, proportionably high, and intermixt with Obeliſques, which ſo many Ages have never been able yet to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh. Even the Colours, that is to ſay, that which rather tryed the Power of time, are ſtill preſerved among the Ruines of that admirable Edifice; ay, and preſerved in their Strength and Vivacity: So skilled was <hi>Egypt</hi> in imprinting the Characters of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality on all her Works. Now that the Name of the King is gone thro' all the unknown Parts of the World, and that that Prince likewiſe extends his Reſearches as far as he hath cauſed to be made the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Works of Nature and of Art, would it not be an Object worthy of ſo noble a

And what Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties might there not be found if we come yet unto this Royal City, ſince that at ſo great a Diſtance from it, ſuch Marvels are diſcovered?</p>
               <p>But it is <hi>Egypt's</hi> Glory alone to erect Monuments for Poſterity. Her Obeliſques, even at this day, as well by their Beauty as their heighth, do make up the chief Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Rome;</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing of ever equalling the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> thought it would pretty well contribute to their Greatneſs by borrowing the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Kings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Egypt</hi> had not yet ſeen any great Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings beſides the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> when ſhe invented her Pyramids, which as well by their Figures as by their Grandeur trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed over Time and <hi>Barbarians.</hi> The good Judgment of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> made them then to be in love only with things truly Solid and Regular. Whether Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of her ſelf, brought it to that ſimple Air to which it is ſo hard to return, when the Judgment was vitiated by Novelties and extravagant attempts however it be, the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi> have only loved regular attempts: they have only aimed to be new and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing in the infinite variety of Nature, and boaſted that they only, like the Gods, had made Immortal Works. The Inſcriptions
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:56382:239"/> of the Pyramids, were no leſs noble than the work it ſelf. They ſpake to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders.

                  </note> It was built on the ſide of the Lake of <hi>Myris,</hi> and a proſpect was given to it proportionably to the Grandeur of it.

Fifteen hundred Chambers joined to Teraſs Walks, were all ranged round a dozen Halls, and all thoſe that came to viſit them, were at a loſs how to find their way out again.

               <p>Therefore I know not at what time <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh</hi> could extend her Conqueſts even to <hi>Troy,</hi> becauſe we ſee ſo little likelyhood that <hi>Ninus</hi> and <hi>Semiramis</hi> had undertook any ſuch thing; and that all their Succeſſors, to begin from their Son <hi>Ninyas,</hi> have lived in ſuch an effeminate Softneſs, and with ſo little Action, that ſcarce their Names have reached to our Ears, and we might much rather wonder how their Empire was able to ſubſiſt ſo long, than believe it could be ſo enlarged.</p>
               <p>It was, queſtionleſs, much diminiſhed by the Conqueſts of <hi>Seſoſtris;</hi> but as they were of a ſhort Continuance, and but poorly kept
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:56382:246"/> up by his Succeſſors, we may eaſily believe that the Countries which they took from the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> being uſed a long time to their Domination, would naturally turn to them again: So that that Empire kept it ſelf in great Puiſſance, and in great Peace, until that <hi>Arbaces</hi> having diſcovered the ſoftneſs of their Kings, ſo long concealed in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of their Palaces, <hi>Sardanapulus</hi> celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his Infamies, became not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, but alſo inſupportable to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>You have ſeen the Kingdoms that came from the Ruines of that firſt Empire of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> among others, that of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> and that of <hi>Babylon.</hi> The Kings of <hi>Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh</hi> retained the Name of Kings of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and were the moſt puiſſant. Their Pride quickly raiſed them above all Bounds by the Conqueſts they obtained, among which is accounted that of the Kingdom of the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> or of <hi>Samaria.</hi> It could be nothing leſs than the Hand of God, and a viſible Miracle, that kept them from overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Judea</hi> under <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> and it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known what Bounds could be given to their Power, when they were ſeen a little while after in their Neighbourhood to invade the Kingdom of <hi>Babylon,</hi> where the Royal Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was decay'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Babylon</hi> ſeemed to be born to command all the World.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Herod.</hi> 1.</note> and its Abundance made the ancient Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> look on it as a third part of ſo great an Empire. Thus the Kings of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyria,</hi> ſwoln with an Increaſe which added to their Monarchy ſo opulent a City, formed new Deſigns. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> the firſt thought his Empire unworthy of him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he could add the whole Univerſe to it. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> the ſecond, prouder than all the Kings his Predeceſſors, after his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of Succeſſes, and aſtoniſhing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, rather choſe to make himſelf be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored as a God, than to command as a King. What works did not he undertake in <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon?</hi> What Walls, what Towers, what Gates, and what Circumvallations were there ſeen? It ſeemed as if the old Tower of <hi>Babel</hi> was going to be renewed in the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious height of the Temple of <hi>Bel,</hi> and that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had reſolved to ſtorm Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven anew. His Pride, although brought down by the hand of God, did not ceaſe to ſpring up again in his Succeſſors. They could not induce any Domination about them; and reſolving to bring all under the Yoke, they became inſupportable to the neighbouring People. That Jealouſie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united againſt them together, with the Kings of <hi>Media</hi> and the Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> a great part of the Eaſtern People.<note place="margin">

               <p>The Fate of this great City was ſtrange, ſeeing ſhe fell by her own Inventions. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi> had almoſt in her vaſt Plains the ſame effect as <hi>Nilus</hi> had in thoſe of <hi>Egypt:</hi> but to make it more commodious, there was required more of Art and Labour than <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> uſed for the <hi>Nile.</hi>

                     <hi>Herod.</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Euphrates</hi> was direct in its Courſe, and never overflowed. They were forced to make throughout all the Country an infinite number of Chanels, that ſo it might water their Grounds, whoſe fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs by that means became incomparable. To break the violence of its too impetuous Waters, it was neceſſary to make it run thro' a thouſand Turnings, and to hollow it with great Lakes, which a wiſe Queen filled up again with an incredible magnificence. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocris,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Labynithes,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Nabonides,</hi> or <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> the laſt King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> did thoſe great Works. But that Queen undertook a Buſineſs much more ſurpriſing and marvellous: It was to build a Stone Bridge over <hi>Euphrates,</hi> that ſo the two Quarters of the City, which the vaſt largeneſs of that River ſeparated at two great a diſtance, might communicate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It was neceſſary therefore firſt to dry up ſo rap'd and ſo deep a River, by turning thoſe Waters into a moſt huge and unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:56382:247"/> Lake which yet that Queen cauſed to be digged. At the ſame time they built the Bridge, the ſolid Materials whereof were prepared before, and they bricked up the two ſides of the River to a moſt aſtoniſhing heighth, making Deſcents from it likewiſe of Brick, and of as good Work as the Walls of the City. The Diligence that was uſed herein equalled he Grandeur of it. But a Queen ſo diſcerning as ſhe was, yet never thought that ſhe inſtructed her Enemies how to take her City.<note place="margin">Herod. ibid.</note> It was into that ſame Lake which ſhe had hollowed that <hi>Cyrus</hi> turned <hi>Euphrates,</hi> when deſpairing of his reducing <hi>Babylon,</hi> either by Force or Famine, he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened into it from the two ſides of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that Paſſage which we have ſeen ſo much pointed at by the Prophets.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Babylon</hi> could have but believed ſhe had been periſhable as all other humane things, and an extravagant confidence had not thrown her into downright blindneſs:<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> ſhe might not only have been able to foreſee what <hi>Cyrus</hi> did, ſeeing that the remembrance of ſuch a Work as that was very freſh; but alſo by guarding all the Deſcents ſhe had overthrown the <hi>Perſians</hi> in the Chanel of the River where they paſſed. But they thought of nothing but their Pleaſures and Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments: they had neither order nor any regular command in them. And ſo are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed not only the ſtrongeſt Places, but alſo the greateſt Empires. Dread and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment filled every place; the Impious King was killed, and <hi>Xenophon,</hi> who gives that Title to the laſt King of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

               <p>The <hi>Medes,</hi> who had deſtroyed the firſt and chiefeſt Empire of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed alſo the ſecond, as if that Nation had been deſignated to be fatal to the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Grandeur. But at this laſt time the valour and great name of <hi>Cyrus</hi> made the <hi>Perſians</hi> his Subjects to have the honour of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. And indeed, it was entirely owing to this Hero,<note place="margin">Xenoph. Cyr. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> who having been bred up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſevere and regular Diſcipline, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Cuſtom of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> a People alſo then as moderate, as ſince they have been voluptuous, was enured from his Infancy to a ſober and military Life. The <hi>Medes</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore ſo laborious and martial, but at length being ſoftened through their Plenty and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, as it always happens, had great need of ſuch a General. <hi>Cyrus</hi> made uſe of their Riches and of their Name, always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected in the Eaſt:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pol.</hi> 5.44.10 24. <hi>Xenoph.

The Conquerour ſent a Challenge to the new King; and by ſhewing his Courage, he gave himſelf the reputation of a merciful Prince who ſpares the Blood of his Subjects. To his Valour he joyned Policy; For fear of ruining ſo fine a Country, which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready looked on as his Conqueſt, he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to have the Labourers ſaved on both ſides. He knew how to awaken the Jealouſie of the neighbouring People againſt the proud
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:56382:248"/> and haughty Puiſſance of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that was for Invading all; and at length the Glory that he gained, as much by his Generoſity and Juſtice, as by the Happineſs of his Arms, having reunited them all under his Standards, with ſuch great Aſſiſtances he ſubdued that vaſt extent of Land whereof he made his Empire.</p>
               <p>Thus was this Monarchy raiſed. <hi>Cyrus</hi> made it ſo Puiſſant, that it could not very much fail of aggrandizing it ſelf under its Succeſſors. But to underſtand how it came to be deſtroyed, we need only to compare the <hi>Perſians</hi> and the Succeſſors of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> with the <hi>Greeks</hi> and their Generals, eſpecially with <hi>Alexander.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>CAMBYSES</hi> the Son of <hi>Cyrus</hi> was he who corrupted the Manners of the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> His Father,<note place="margin">V. <hi>The</hi> Perſians, <hi>the</hi> Grecians, <hi>and</hi> Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> who was ſo well brought up in all the Arts and Cares of War, took not care enough to give to the Succeſſor of ſo great an Empire an Education ſuitable to his own: and by the common Fate of humane things too much greatneſs deſtroys Vertue. <hi>Darius</hi> the Son of <hi>Hyſtaſpes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plat. de leg. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> who from a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Life was raiſed unto the Throne, brought better diſpoſitions to the Soveraign Power, and made ſome efforts to repair the Diſorders. But the Corruption was already too univerſal: Abundance had introduced great Irregularities into their Manners; and <hi>Darius</hi> had not himſelf obſerved ſo juſt a ſtrictneſs as to be able on the ſudden to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs others. Every thing degenerated under his Succeſſors, and the Luxury of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi>
                  <pb n="484" facs="tcp:56382:249"/> was not circumſcribed by any Bounds or Meaſure.</p>
               <p>But although thoſe People, then become powerful, had loſt very much of their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Vertue, by giving themſelves up to their Pleaſures, they had yet always kept up ſomething that was great and noble. What is there to be ſeen more noble than the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour they had for lying, which was always accounted by them a moſt baſe and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Vice?<note place="margin">Plat. Alcib. <hi>1.</hi> Herod. lib. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> What they looked upon as very unworthy next to lying, was to live upon borrowing. Such a Life as that ſeemed to them to be idle, ſhameful, ſervile, and ſo much the more contemptible, as it led on to lying. By a Generoſity that was natural to their Nation,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Herod.</hi> 3.</note> they always treated van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed Kings with great Civility. If the Children of thoſe Princes were not able to be aſſiſtant to the Conquerours, they left them to Command in their own Countries with almoſt all the Marks of their ancient Grandeur. The <hi>Perſians</hi> were Courteous, Civil, Liberal to Strangers, and they knew how to make uſe of them. Perſons of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit were conſidered by them, and they ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for nothing to gain them. 'Tis true, they were not arrived at the perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that Wiſdom which inſtructed how to govern well. The great Empire was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ruled with ſome confuſion. They could never find out that curious Art ſo well pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed ſince by the <hi>Romans,</hi> of uniting all the Parts of a great Eſtate, and making but one perfect whole of them. So likewiſe were they ſcarce ever without ſome conſiderable
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:56382:249"/> Revolts. Yet they had their Polity among them. The Rules of Juſtice they underſtood, and they have had great Kings which have made them be obſerved with an admirable exactneſs. Crimes were ſeverely puniſhed, but with that moderation, that in eaſily pardoning the firſt Faults,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Herod.</hi> 1.</note> they corrected the after Relapſes with rigorous Chaſtiſements. They had a great many good Laws,<note place="margin">

                  </note> were the Eyes and the Ears of the Prince; they meant all together with the Prince: that he had his Miniſters as we have the Organs of our Senſes, not for him to be idle, but to act by their means; and the Miniſters, that they were not to act for themſelves, but for the Prince who was their Chief, and for all the Body of the State. Thoſe Miniſters were to be inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ancient Maxims of the Monarchy.

                     <hi>Herod.</hi> 1.</note> to tell them that they never were to Sacrifice for themſelves alone, but for the King, and for all the State, in which every one was concerned
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:56382:250"/> with the other. One of the chiefeſt cares of the Prince was to ſee Agriculture flouriſh: and thoſe Noblemen whoſe Government was the beſt cultivated, had the greateſt part of the Thanks. As there were Offices ſet up for the Conduct of Arms, ſo there were likewiſe ſome eſtabliſhed to inſpect into the Country Labours: So that they were two Charges alike, one of which was to take care to preſerve the Country, and the other to cultivate it. The Price protected them with almoſt an equal affection, and made them to concur to the Weal-Publick. Next to thoſe who had brought ſome advantages from the War, they were moſt honoured who had bred up a great many Children. The reſpect wherewith the <hi>Perſians</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired from their Infancy for Regal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was grown to that exceſs, that they min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled Adoration with it, and appeared ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Slaves than Subjects, brought by reaſon to pay their Submiſſion to a legitimate Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: This was the Eaſtern Humour, and peradventure the brisk and violent Nature of thoſe People required a Government that was more firm and more abſolute.</p>
               <p>The manner how they bred up the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Kings is admired by <hi>Plato,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the <hi>Grecians</hi> as the model of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Education.<note place="margin">Plat. Alcib. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> At ſeven Years of Age, they are taken from the hands of the Eunuchs to teach them how to ride on Horſeback, and to follow the Chaſe.

<pb n="487" facs="tcp:56382:250"/> can be found out in the Kingdom. The firſt, ſays <hi>Plato,</hi> teaches them Magick, that is to ſay in their Language, the Worſhip of the Gods, according to the antient Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims, and according to the Laws of <hi>Zoroaſtres</hi> the Son of <hi>Oromaſes.</hi> The ſecond inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them how to ſpeak the Truth, and how to do Juſtice. The third taught them how they ſhould not ſuffer themſelves to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by their Pleaſures, that ſo they might be always free and truly Kings, Maſters of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and of their deſires. The fourth fortified their Courage againſt Fear, which had made ſlaves of them, and had robbed them of that Confidence, which was ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for Command. The young Lords were bred up at the Gate of the King with his Children,<note place="margin">Xenoph. de ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. Cyri. Jun. lib. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> there was particular Care ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that they ſhould neither ſee nor hear any thing that was unbecoming, they gave the King an account of their Conduct. And that account which was given of them; was by his Order attended with ſuitable Puniſhments or Rewards. The Youth who ſaw them, did early with their Vertue, learn the knowledg of both, how to obey and command. And with ſuch an Inſtitution, what might not be hoped for from the Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and their Nobles, if as great a Care had been taken to direct them well in the Progreſs of their Age, as there always was to inſtruct them in their Infancy? But the corrupted Manners of the Nation drew them quickly into their Enchanted Pleaſures, againſt which no Education can Fence. Yet it muſt be confeſſed, that notwithſtanding
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:56382:251"/> the Effeminacy of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Care they had of their Beauty, and of their Dreſs, they wanted not Valour. They ſtood always much on that, and they have given very ſignal marks of it. The Military Art with them had the preference it deſerved, as that under the Covert, whereof all others might be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in quiet.<note place="margin">Xenoph.</note> But they never underſtood the bottom of it, nor knew what an Army could do that uſed Severity, Diſcipline, rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Troops, the order of Marches and Incampments; and to conclude, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Conduct, which made thoſe great Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to move without Confuſion, and in the beſt manner. They thought they had done all, when they had collected together a huge number of People without any choice, to go to the War with Bravery and Courage, but without Order, and who found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Embaraſſed with an infinite multitude of unneceſſary Perſons, whom the King and the great Men drew after them only for their Pleaſures. For their Effeminacy was ſo great, that they would find in the Army the ſame Magnificence and delicacies as in thoſe places where the Court made its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Commoration and Stay, ſo that the Kings marched with their Wives, their Concubines, their Eunuchs, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver elſe might contribute to their Pleaſures. Their Gold and Silver Veſſels, and the beſt ſort of moveable Houſhold Goods follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a moſt prodigious abundance; and in ſhort, all the train that ſuch a Life requires. An Army made up of this manner, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:56382:251" rendition="simple:additions"/> encumbred with the exceſſive Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of its Soldiers, was overcharged by the unaccountable number of thoſe who did not Fight. In this Confuſion, it was impoſſible to move in any Regularity, and by conſent; the Orders never came in time, and in any action all went as they could, and no body could make any Proviſion or Forecaſt. And withal they muſt make but a ſhort work of it, and come rapidly like a Torrent into a Country: for ſuch a vaſt Body, and greedy not only of what was neceſſary for Life, but alſo what was Serviceable for their Pleaſure, conſum'd all in a little time, and one can ſcarce imagine where they could get all their ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>And yet with this great Pomp and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony did the <hi>Perſians</hi> aſtoniſh the People that underſtood the trade of War no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than themſelves. And thoſe who did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, found themſelves either weakned by their own diviſions, or overpowred by the Multitude of their Enemies; and by that means it was that <hi>Egypt,</hi> a proud as ſhe ſeemed to be both of her Antiquity, and of her wiſe Inſtitutions, and of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of her <hi>Seſoſtris,</hi> became ſubjected to the <hi>Perſians.</hi> It was no hard matter for them to conquer the leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> and alſo the <hi>Greek</hi> Colonies, which the ſoftneſs of <hi>Aſia</hi> had Corrupted. But when they came to <hi>Greece</hi> it ſelf, they found what they had never ſeen, a regulated Militia, well bred Commanders, Soldiers uſed to live ſparingly, Bodies hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Travel, which the Lute, and other Exerciſes common in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:56382:252" rendition="simple:additions"/> had made dexterous and nimble; Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies very ſmall indeed, but yet were like to thoſe vigorous Bodies that ſeem to be all nervous, and where all is made up of Life and Spirit; and withal ſo well commanded, and ſo compliant to the orders of their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, that one would think that the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers had all but one and the ſame Soul, ſuch an exact harmony of agreement was ſeen in all their Motions.</p>
               <p>But what <hi>Greece</hi> had ſtill, that was more great, was a firm and Provident Politie, that underſtood how to abandon, hazard and defend what was neceſſary, and what was greater yet, a Courage, which the love of Liberty, and that of its Country made invincible.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> naturally full of Spirit and Courage had been early cultivated by Kings and Colonies come from <hi>Egypt,</hi> which eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing themſelves at the firſt in divers parts of the Country, had every where diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that excellent Politie of the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> From thence they learnt the Exerciſes of the Body, the Lute, Foot-races, running on Horſeback, and in Chariots, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Exerciſes which they put in Perfection by the glorious Crowns of the Olympic Games. But the beſt thing of all which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> had taught them was Docility, and how they ſhould form themſelves by Laws for the publick Weal. This was not in particular relating only to their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate affairs, nor only minding the Evils of the State, ſo far as they themſelves ſuffered by them, or the quiet of their Families
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:56382:252"/> were diſturbed and troubled. The <hi>Greeks</hi> were taught how to look after themſelves, and alſo to have a regard for their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, as they were part of a greater Body, which was the Body of the State. Parents educated their Children in this Principle; and the Children learnt from their Cradles to look upon their Country as a common Mother, to whom they belonged even more than to their Parents. The word <hi>Civility</hi> did not only ſignify among the <hi>Greeks</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, Kindneſs, and mutual deference, which made Men Sociable: a Civil Man was nothing elſe but a good Citizen, who always conſidered himſelf as a Member of the State, which ſubmitted to be governed by Laws, and with them. Conſpired to the publick good, without making invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon any Man's right and property. The antient Kings whom the <hi>Greeks</hi> had had in divers Countries, as <hi>Minos, Cecrops,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plat. de leg. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus, Codrus Temenes, Creſphontus, Eury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes, Patroclus,</hi> and ſuch as theſe, had infuſed this Principle into all the Nation. They were all popular, not at all in flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the People, but in procuring their well-fare, and in making the Laws to be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſay of the gravity of their Judgments? What graver Tribunal was there ever than that of the <hi>Areopagus</hi> ſo much had in reverence throughout all <hi>Greece,</hi> as that it was ſaid the Gods appeared there? It has been famous from the earlieſt of time; and <hi>Cecrops</hi> probably founded it after the model of the Tribunals in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi>
                  <pb n="492" facs="tcp:56382:253"/> Not any Society has ſo long kept up the reputation of its ancient Gravity; for all manner of deceitful <hi>Rhetorick</hi> was ever ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> thus poliſhed by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, thought they were able to govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and moſt of the Cities formed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into Common-Wealths. But the wiſe Legiſlators, who were ſet up in every Country, <hi>Thales, Pythagoras, Pittacus, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus, Solon, Philolas,</hi> and as many others, as Hiſtories inform us of, took care that Liberty ſhould not degenerate into Licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. Laws ſimply writ, and few in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, kept the People in their Duty, and made them all concur to the publick Weal of the Country.</p>
               <p>The Idea of Liberty which ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct inſpired, was admirable: For the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which the <hi>Greeks</hi> figured to themſelves, was a Liberty ſubject to the Law, that is to ſay, to Reaſon it ſelf acknowledged by all the People. They would not have Men to have Power among them. The Magiſtrates who were feared during the time of their Miniſtry, became private Men, who had only ſo much Authority as their Experience gave them. The Law was look'd on as the Miſtreſs; It was that which ſet up Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, regulated their Power, and in a word, which puniſhed their Male-admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</p>
               <p>It is not here neceſſary to examine whether thoſe Ideas were as ſolid as they were ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. In ſhort, <hi>Greece</hi> was charmed with them, and preferred the Inconveniencies of
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:56382:253" rendition="simple:additions"/> Liberty to thoſe of lawful Subjection, tho' in reality much leſs. But as every form of Government has its Advantages, that which <hi>Greece</hi> got from her own, was, that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens were ſo much the more in Love with their own Country, as the all contributed to its Adminiſtration and Government, and as every private Man might come up to the higheſt Honours.</p>
               <p>How far Philoſophy helped to preſerve the State of <hi>Greece</hi> is incredible. The more thoſe People were free, the more neceſſary was it to eſtabliſh among them Rules of good Manners, and of Society. <hi>Pythagoras, Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, Anaxagoras, Socrates, Archytas, Plato, Xenophon, Ariſtotle,</hi> and a world of others, filled <hi>Greece</hi> with thoſe excellent Precep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There were ſome extravagant Men that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the Name of Philoſophers, but thoſe who were followed were ſuch as taught them to ſacrifice their private Intereſt, and even their own Lives, for the general Intereſt and Safety of the State: And it was the moſt common Maxim of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, that Men ought either to withdraw from publick Affairs, or elſe only have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the publick Weal.</p>
               <p>But why do we ſpeak of the Philoſophers? The very Poets themſelves, who were in the Hands of all the People, inſtruct them much more than they divert them. The moſt famous of Conquerors look on <hi>Homer</hi> as a Maſter that taught to reign well. That great Poet no leſs inſtructed how to obey well, and to be a good Citizen; He and a many others, whoſe Works are equally
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:56382:254"/> grave as they are pleaſant, celebrate only thoſe Arts that are uſeful to human Life, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend only the publick Weal, their Country, Society, and that admirable Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility which we have here diſplayed.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Greece</hi> was thus refined, ſhe look'd on the Aſiaticks with their Delicacy, their ſtarched Dreſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But their form of Government which was only regulated by the Will and Command of their Prince, which was the Miſtreſs of all, even their moſt ſacred Laws, wrought an abſolute Abhorrence in them: And the moſt odious Object that all <hi>Greece</hi> had, were the <hi>Barbarians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Grecians</hi> conceived this hatred from the very beginning, and it was become as their ſecond Nature.<note place="margin">Iſoc.

She could by no means ſuffer <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> to think of ſubduing her; for in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
<pb facs="tcp:56382:254"/> that Yoke, ſhe knew ſhe muſt ſubject Vertue to Pleaſure, the Mind to the Body, and true Courage to a mad extravagant Force, which conſiſts only in the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Greece</hi> was full of thoſe Sentiments, when ſhe was attacked by <hi>Darius</hi> the Son of <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſpes,</hi> and by <hi>Xerxes,</hi> with Armies whoſe greatneſs ſeems fabulous, becauſe it was ſo exceſſive. Immediately each are prepared to defend their Liberty. Although all the Cities of <hi>Greece</hi> were as ſo many Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, yet their common Intereſt reunited them, and there were no Diſputes among them, but to ſhew who ſhould do moſt for the Publick Weal. It coſt the <hi>Athenians</hi> nothing to leave their City to be pillaged and burnt: and after they had ſaved their old Men and their Wives with their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they put into Ships all that were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of bearing Arms. To put a ſtop for ſome days to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Army at a ſtrait and difficult Paſſage; and to make it ſenſible what <hi>Greece</hi> was, a handful of <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ran with their King to an aſſured Death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contented that in ſo dying they had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to their Country an infinite number of thoſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and had left to their Compatriots the brave Example of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of Boldneſs and Gallantry. Againſt ſuch Armies and ſuch a Conduct <hi>Perſia</hi> found her ſelf weak, and oftentimes found to her loſs, what Diſcipline could do againſt Multitude and Confuſion, and what Valour was able to effect, that was conducted with Art againſt a blind Impetuoſity.</p>
               <pb n="496" facs="tcp:56382:255"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perſia</hi> that was ſo many times overcome, had nothing left to do but to make diviſion among the <hi>Greeks:</hi> and the condition in which they found themſelves by their Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, made that an eaſie Enterpriſe. As Fear kept them united, ſo Victory and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence broke that Union.<note place="margin">Plat. de Leg. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> Being uſed to fight and to conquer, when they thought they had nothing more to fear from the power of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> they fell then one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another. But that State of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the Secret of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Polity wants a little further Explication.</p>
               <p>Among all the Republicks, of which <hi>Greece</hi> was made up, <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> were incomparatively the Chief. There could not be more Wit than was to be had at <hi>Athens,</hi> nor more force and ſtrength than what <hi>Lacedemonia</hi> afforded. <hi>Athens</hi> was ſet upon Pleaſure; the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> life was hard and laborious. They both loved Glory and Liberty: but at <hi>Athens</hi> Liberty naturally tended to Licentiouſneſs; and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonia</hi> being held in by her ſevere Laws, the more ſhe was ſuppreſſed within, the more did ſhe indeavour to enlarge her Dominion abroad. <hi>Athens</hi> was deſirous all of Rule, but it was from another Principle. Intereſt and Honour went together. Her Citizens were excellent in the Art of Navigation; and the Sea o're which ſhe reigned had enriched her. To make her ſelf ſole Miſtreſs of all Commerce, there was nothing ſhe could not attempt to ſubject; and her Riches which had filled her with that deſire, furniſhed her with ways and means how to ſatisfie it. On
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:56382:255"/> the contrary, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tempt. As all her Laws tended to make her a Martial Republic, the glory of Arms was the only Charm wherewith the Minds of her Citizens were poſſeſſed. From thence naturally ſhe was ambitious of Domination, and the more ſhe was above Intereſt, the more ſhe gave her ſelf up to Ambition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lacedemonia</hi> by her regular Life was firm in her Maxims and Deſigns. <hi>Athens</hi> was more quick and Spiritual, and the People there were too much Maſters. Philoſophy and the Laws indeed wrought very good Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in ſuch exquiſete Natures, but Reaſon by it ſelf was not able to retain them.<note place="margin">Plat. de Leg. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> A wiſe <hi>Athenian,</hi> and one who admirably well underſtood the temper and Complexion of his Country informs us, that Fear was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary for Minds that were ſo ſprightly and ſo free, and that there was no longer any governing of them, when the Victory of <hi>Salamine</hi> had ſecured them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Perſians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then two things deſtroyed them, the glory of their famous Actions, and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, in which they thought they were. The Magiſtrates were no longer obeyed, and as <hi>Perſia</hi> was afflicted through an exceſſive Subjection, ſo <hi>Athens, Plato</hi> ſays; felt the Calamities of an exceſſive Liberty.</p>
               <p>Thoſe two great Commonwealths, ſo contrary in their Tempers and Conduct, yet embraced each other in the deſign they had to reduce all <hi>Greece;</hi> ſo that they were always Enemies, and they were more ſo
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:56382:256"/> from the contrariety of their Intereſts, than from the incompatibility of their Humours.</p>
               <p>The Cities of <hi>Greece</hi> deſired no Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation over either of them: for beſides that, every one wiſhed to be able to preſerve their own Liberty, they found the Empire of thoſe too Republicks too troubleſome. That of <hi>Lacedemonia</hi> was fierce. There was in her People, an I know not what of a wild Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. A Government too rigid, and a Life too laborious,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ariſt.

Lac. Plat. de rep. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> but by an uninterrupted continuance of it. Thus the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> reſolved to Command, and all the World was afraid leſt they ſhould Command. The <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> were naturally more mild and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. There was nothing to be ſeen more delightful than their City, where their Feaſts and their Plays were perpetual; where wit, where liberty, the Paſſions afforded every day new Spectacles. But their unequal Conduct was diſpleaſing to their Allies, and was yet more inſupportable to their Subjects. It was therefore neceſſary to ſhake off the Fantaſtry of a flattered People, that is, to ſay, according to <hi>Plato,</hi> ſomething more dangerous than that of a Prince corrupted by Flattery.</p>
               <p>Thoſe two Cities never ſuffered <hi>Greece</hi> to be at quiet. You have ſeen the <hi>Peloponeſian</hi> War, and the others always cauſed or kept
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:56382:256" rendition="simple:additions"/> up by the Jealouſies of <hi>Lacedemonia</hi> and <hi>Athens:</hi> But thoſe Jealouſies, which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled <hi>Greece,</hi> did alſo in ſome ſort ſupport it, and prevented it from becoming a depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on one of thoſe two Republicks.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Perſians</hi> ſoon perceived this Eſtate of <hi>Greece.</hi> Therefore all the Secret of their Politie, was to keep up thoſe Jealouſies, and to foment thoſe Diviſions. <hi>Lacedemonia,</hi> which was the moſt ambitious, was the firſt to engage them in the Quarrels of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> They eſpouſed them, with a deſign of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king themſelves Maſters of all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and being careful to weaken the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> the one by the other, they only watched for the good Hour, when to overthow them all together.

The Diviſions of <hi>Greece</hi> were the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing that put a ſtop to his Conqueſts: But it happened at a time when young <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> revolted againſt
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:56382:257"/> him. He had ten Thouſand <hi>Grecians</hi> in his Troops, which alone could not be broken in the Univerſal rout of his Army. He was killed in the Battle, and as it is reported, by the hand of <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi> Our <hi>Greeks</hi> were found without a Protector; in the midſt of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and round about <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi> Yet victorious <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> could neither oblige them voluntarily to lay down their Arms, nor force them to it. They attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the bold Deſign of going through all his Empire in an armed Body, and ſo return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own Country, which they according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompliſhed. All <hi>Greece</hi> ſaw then more than ever, that ſhe trained up an invincible Militia, to which every thing was to yield, and that only her own Diviſions could ſubject her to an Enemy, who would yet be too weak to reſiſt her when ſhe was united. <hi>Philip,</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> equall able and Valiant, ſo well improved the advantages which were given him againſt ſo many divided Cities and Commonwealths by a Kingdom, little indeed of it ſelf, but united, and where the Royal Power was abſolute, that at laſt partly by Stratagem, and partly by force, he made himſelf the moſt puiſſant of <hi>Greece,</hi> and obliged all the <hi>Grecians</hi> to march under his Standards againſt the Common Enemy. He was ſlain in thoſe Conjunctures: but <hi>Alexander</hi> his Son ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to his Kingdom, and to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.</p>
               <p>He found the <hi>Macedonians</hi> not only trained up to Martial diſcipline, but alſo triumphant, and become by ſo many ſucceſſes almoſt as
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:56382:257"/> much ſuperiour to the other <hi>Grecians</hi> in Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Diſcipline, as the other <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were above the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and ſuch like ſort of People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Darius,</hi> who reigned in <hi>Perſia,</hi> in his time, was juſt, valiant, generous, beloved of his People, and wanted neither Wit nor Courage to execute his Deſigns. But if you compare him with <hi>Alexander;</hi> his Wit with that piercing and ſublime Genius: His Valour with that haughtineſs and ſteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that invincible Courage, which was the more animated by the Obſtacles that he met with; with that unmeaſurable Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of encreaſing daily his Name, which made him prefer the leaſt advance of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to all manner of Dangers, Labours, and to a thouſand Deaths: In a word, with that Confidence that made him think verily and from his Heart, that all ought to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to him, as to one whom his Deſtiny rendred ſuperiour to all others; a Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which he inſpired not only into his Chiefs, but alſo into the leaſt of his Soldiers, whom he raiſed by that means, above difficulties, and even above themſelves. You will quickly judg to whom of them two the Victory belonged. And if you add to theſe things the advantages which the <hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Macedonians</hi> had above their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, you will confeſs that <hi>Perſia</hi> being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked by ſuch an <hi>Hero,</hi> and by ſuch Arms, could no longer hold out from changing Maſters.

When he was but three and thirty Years of Age, in the midſt of the vaſteſt Deſigns that ever Man had conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and with the juſteſt hopes of a moſt happy Succeſs, he died before he had the opportunity ſolidly to ſettle his affairs, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a weak Brother, and Children very young behind him, incapable of ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo great a weight. But what was moſt fatal both to his Houſe, and to his Empire, was, that he left behind him Captains, whom he had taught to breath out nothing but Ambition and War. He ſaw to what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes they would riſe when he ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the World. He, to retain them, and for fear he ſhould be contradicted, durſt neither name his Succeſſor, nor who ſhould be the Tutor of his Children. He only foretold them, that his Friends would cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate his Funerals with bloody Battles, and ſo he expired in the flower of his Age, full of ſad Images and Ideas of the Confuſion which would attend his Death.</p>
               <p>In fine, you have ſeen the partage of his Empire, and the frightful ruin of his Houſe. <hi>Macedonia,</hi> his antient Kingdom, enjoyed by his Anceſtors for ſo many Ages,
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:56382:259"/> was invaded on all ſides as a vacant Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and after it had been long the Prey of the ſtrongeſt, it went at laſt to another Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. Thus that great Conquerour, the moſt renowned, and moſt illuſtrious that ever was, was likewiſe the laſt of his Race. If he had continued peaceable and quiet in <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,</hi> the greatneſs of his Empire would not have been a temptation to his Captains, and he might have left to his Children the Kingdom of his Fathers. But becauſe he had been ſo very powerful, he was the cauſe of the loſs of all his own; and thus you ſee what was the glorious fruit of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Conqueſts.</p>
               <p>His Death was the only cauſe of that great revolution. For this muſt be ſaid to his eternal Honour, that if ever Man was capable of maintaining ſo vaſt an Empire, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though newly conquered, without doubt it was <hi>Alexander;</hi> for the ſtrength of his Mind was equal to his Courage. It ow'd not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to his faults, tho' he had very great ones, the fall of his Family, but only to Mortality; unleſs we will ſay that a Man of his Humour, and whoſe ambition engaged him ſtill to new undertakings, could never be at leiſure to ſettle things well.</p>
               <p>Be it how it will, we learn by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that beſides the Faults which Men might correct, that is to ſay, thoſe they are guilty of thro' heat of Tranſport, or thro' Ignorance, there is an irrecoverable Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs inſeparably annexed to humane De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and that is Mortality. Every thing may fall in a Moment by that way: That
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:56382:259"/> which forces us to confeſs that as the moſt inherent Vice, if it may be allowed me to ſpeak ſo, and the moſt inſeparable from humane things, is their own Frailty: He who knows how to preſerve and ſtrengthen a State, hath found out a higher point of Wiſdom than he that can conquer and gain Battles.</p>
               <p>It is needleſs to tell you in particular what deſtroyed thoſe Kingdoms that were formed out of the Ruins of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Empire, that is to ſay, that of <hi>Syria,</hi> that of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,</hi> and that of <hi>Egypt.</hi> The common cauſe of their Ruine was, that they were forced to ſubmit to a greater Power, which was the <hi>Roman.</hi> If however we will conſider the laſt Eſtate of thoſe Monarchies, we ſhall eaſily find the immediate Cauſes of their Fall; and ſee among other things, that the moſt puiſſant of all, that is to ſay, that of <hi>Syria,</hi> after it had been ſhaken by the ſoft Effeminacy and Luxury of the Nation, at laſt received the mortal Stab by the Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her Princes.</p>
               <p>WE are at laſt brought to the great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire which hath ſwallowed up all the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires of the World,<note place="margin">The <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</note> from whence hath ſprung the greateſt Kingdoms of the Earth where we dwell, whole Laws we ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and which conſequently we ought to undeſtand better than all other Empires. Your Highneſs very well knows, I ſpeak of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. You have ſeen the long and memorable Hiſtory of it in all its Courſe. But to make you perfectly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:56382:260"/> with the cauſes of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thoſe of the great Changes that have happened in that Common-Wealth; You are ſeriouſly, with the Manners and Cuſtoms of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to conſider alſo the times on which all the Motions of that vaſt Empire do depend.</p>
               <p>Of all People in the World, the moſt fierce and hardy, but likewiſe the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular in their Councils, the moſt conſtant in their Maxims, the moſt laborious, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al the moſt patient, have been the People of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From all that, was formed the beſt Militia, and the moſt diſcerning Polity, the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt followed that ever was.</p>
               <p>The Principle of a <hi>Roman</hi> was the Love of his Liberty and of his Country. One of thoſe things made him to love the other: For becauſe he loved his Liberty, he loved alſo his Country as a Mother that fed him with Sentiments equally generous and free.</p>
               <p>Under that Name of Liberty, the <hi>Romans</hi> framed to themſelves a Government like the <hi>Greeks,</hi> where none ſhould be ſubject but only to the Law, and where the Law ſhould be more powerful than Man.</p>
               <p>But though <hi>Rome</hi> was born under a Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Government, yet had ſhe alſo under her Kings a Liberty which was not very much conſiſtent with a regulated Monarchy. For beſides that Kings were Elective, and that ſuch Elections were made by all the People, it was alſo in the People aſſembled together to confirm the Laws, and to reſolve on Peace and War. There were alſo ſome particular
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:56382:260"/> Caſes wherein the Kings admitted the People to have the ſoveraign Judgment: Witneſs <hi>Tullus Hostilius,</hi> who not daring either to condemn or acquit <hi>Horace,</hi> loaded at once both with Honour for having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the <hi>Curatii,</hi> and with Shame and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy for having killed his Siſter, made it be determined by the People. Therefore Kings had properly but the Command of the Armies, and the Authority of calling lawful Aſſemblies, propounding Buſineſſes to them, maintaining the Laws, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the publick Decrees.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Servius Tullius</hi> framed that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign you have ſeen of bringing <hi>Rome</hi> into a Common-Wealth, he increaſed, in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple already ſo free, ſtill a greater Deſire of Liberty; and from that you may judg how mighty jealous the <hi>Romans</hi> were of it, when they had experimented it entirely under their Conſuls.</p>
               <p>One would even tremble to read in Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the dreadful Conſtancy and Reſolution of the Conſul <hi>Brutus,</hi> when he cauſed his two Children to be ſlain before his Eyes, who had ſuffered themſelves to be drawn over to the dull Practices which the <hi>Tarquins</hi> uſed in <hi>Rome</hi> to re-eſtabliſh their Domination there. How much were that People con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the love of Liberty when they could ſee that ſevere Conſul ſacrifice his own Family to Liberty! We need no longer wonder if the Efforts of the neighbouring People were deſpiſed in <hi>Rome,</hi> who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to re-eſtabliſh the baniſhed <hi>Tarquins.</hi> In vain did King <hi>Porſenna</hi> take them into
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:56382:261"/> his Protection. The <hi>Romans</hi> almoſt ſtarved, made him however to know,<note place="margin">Dion. Halic. Lib. <hi>5.</hi> Tit. Liv. <hi>2.13, 15.</hi>
                  </note> by their undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Reſolution, that they would at laſt die free. The People were more reſolute than the Senate; and all <hi>Rome</hi> cauſed it to be told to that puiſſant King that came to reduce her to Extremity, that he might deſiſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding for the <hi>Tarquins,</hi> ſince being reſolved to hazard all for her Liberty, ſhe would rather receive her Enemies than her Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants. <hi>Porſenna</hi> being aſtoniſhed at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedneſs of that People, and at the more than human daringneſs of ſome private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, reſolved to let the <hi>Romans</hi> quietly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a Liberty which they knew ſo well how to defend.</p>
               <p>Liberty therefore was to them a Treaſure which they preferred before all the Riches of the Univerſe. You have ſeen alſo how in their Beginning, and likewiſe forwarder on in ther Progreſs, they looked not on their Poverty as an Evil: But contrariwiſe, they looked on it as a means to preſerve their Liberty more entire; there being nothing more free and independent than a Man that knows how to live on a little, and who Without Expectance of any thing from the Protection or Liberality of another, grounds his Subſiſtence only on his own Induſtry and Labour.</p>
               <p>This did the <hi>Romans.</hi> To feed hardly, to labour in the Earth, to deprive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of all they could, to live with great Frugality and painful Travel: This was their kind of Life; by this way they kept their Families, and brought them up to ſuch like Labours.</p>
               <pb n="509" facs="tcp:56382:261"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Titus Livius</hi> was in the right in ſaying there never was any People among whom Frugality, or Thriftineſs, or Poverty, were had ſo long in Honour. The moſt illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Senators, take them as to their outward appearance, differed very little from Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, and carried no Shew or Majeſty but in Publick and in the Senate. At other times they were ſeen buſie at their Tillage, and the other Cares of a Country Life, when they were ſought for to command their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Theſe Examples are frequent in the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory. <hi>Curius</hi> and <hi>Fabricius,</hi> thoſe great Captains that conquered <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus,</hi> ſo rich a King, had only an earthen Veſſel; and the former, to whom the <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> offered one of Gold and Silver, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that he took no Delight in having them, but in commanding thoſe who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed them. After their Triumphs were over, and they had inriched the Republick with the Spoils of her Enemies, they had not wherewithal to inter themſelves. That Moderation alſo continued during the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> Wars.<note place="margin">Tit. Liv. E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> The Moderation and the Innocence of the <hi>Roman</hi> Generals filled the conquer'd People with Admiration.</p>
               <p>And yet notwithſtanding that great Love of Poverty, the <hi>Romans</hi> never ſpared for any thing that could contribute to the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur and Beauty of their City. From the very beginning their publick Works were ſuch, that <hi>Rome</hi> hath not yet bluſhed to ſee them, tho' at the ſame time ſhe beheld her ſelf Miſtreſs of the World.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tit. Liv.</hi> 1.53, 55, 56. <hi>C.</hi> 5. <hi>Dion. Hal.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Tac.

Every thing elſe was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to that Greatneſs. The principal Temples, the Markets, the Baths, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Places, the great Ways, the Aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts, the very common Shores, and the Kennells of the City had a Magnificence that ſeems almoſt incredible, but that all Hiſtorians do teſtify it, and the Remains we now ſee of it do ſo plainly confirm it. What ſhall I ſay of the Pomp of their Triumphs,<note place="margin">Dion. Hal. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> of the Ceremonies of Religion, of Plays and Spectacles, which they gave to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? In a Word, whatſoever could be of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Service to the Publick, and whatſoever could give the People a great Idea of their common Country, was done with Profuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as much as the time would permit it. Thrift and good Husbandry was only to be ſeen in private Houſes. He who increaſed his Revenues, and made his Lands moſt Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:56382:262"/> by his Induſtry and great Labour, who was the beſt Governor and took the greateſt Share on himſelf, was accounted the moſt Free, the moſt Powerful, and the moſt Happy.</p>
               <p>There was nothing at a greater diſtance from this kind of Living than Effeminacy. Every thing rather tended to exceſs on the other hand, I mean, to Hardſhip. Alſo the Manners of the <hi>Romans</hi> had naturally ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in 'em, which was not only harſh and rigid, but ſavage and cruel. But they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got nothing that might bring them under the Power of good Laws; and they were a People the moſt jealous of their Liberty the World ever ſaw, and yet at the ſame time they were the moſt ſubmiſſive to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and lawful Powers.</p>
               <p>The Militia of ſuch a People could not but be very admirable, ſeeing there was ſo ready and ſo exact an Obedience joyned to reſolute Courages, and as vigorous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               <p>The Laws of that Militia were hard, but neceſſary. The Victory was dangerous, and oft-times mortal to thoſe who gained it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their Orders. It was a capital Crime, not only flying, throwing down their Arms, and going from their Ranks; but alſo ſtirring, as I may ſay, and moveing, tho' never ſo little, without the Command of their General. He that laid down his Arms before the Enemy, that choſe rather to be taken, than to die gloriouſly for his Country, was adjudged unworthy of all manner of Aſſiſtance. Generally Priſoners
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:56382:263"/> were not reckoned any thing by the Citizens, but they were left to the Enemy as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers cut off from the Common-Wealth. You have ſeen in <hi>Florus</hi> and in <hi>Cicero</hi> the Hiſtory of <hi>Regulus,</hi>

                  </note> as a Law inviolable, that a <hi>Roman</hi> Souldier either ought to conquer or to die.</p>
               <p>By which Maxim the <hi>Roman</hi> Armies, tho' deſeated and broken, fought and ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied even to the laſt Extremity: And as <hi>Salluſt</hi> obſerves, there were found among the <hi>Romans</hi> more Perſons puniſhed for having fought without firſt receiving Orders,<note place="margin">Salluſt. de Bell.

                  </note> than for having loſt Ground and quit their Poſt: So that their Courage ſtood more in need of being ſuppreſſed, than their fear of being excited.</p>
               <p>To their Valour they joyned Addreſs and Invention; and beſides their being of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Subtle and Ingenious, they admirably well underſtood how to take Advantage of every thing they ſaw in other People that was uſeful any ways either for Encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for the ordering of their Battles, for
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:56382:263"/> the ſorting of their Arms; in a Word, for facilitating as well the Attack as the Defence. You have ſeen in <hi>Salluſt</hi> and in other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, what the <hi>Romans</hi> have learnt of their Neighbours, and of their very Enemies. Who knows not that they have learnt from the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> the Invention of Gallies, by which they have beat them; and in ſhort, that they have taken from all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they have known, thoſe things by which they have ſubdued them?</p>
               <p>In fine, 'tis certain by their own Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, that the <hi>Gauls</hi> exceeded them in ſtrength of Body, and yielded not to them neither in Courage.<note place="margin">Polib. <hi>2.</hi> &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>Polybius</hi> ſhews us that in one deciſive Rencounter the <hi>Gauls,</hi> beſides their being ſtronger in number, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more Stoutneſs than the <hi>Romans,</hi> how reſolute ſoever they were; and yet we ſee in that very Rencounter, thoſe <hi>Romans</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior in all other things, to get the better of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> becauſe they knew how to chooſe better Arms, to rank themſelves in better order, and to make a better uſe of their time in the Fight. This you may be able one day to ſee more exactly in <hi>Polybius;</hi> and you have oft-times obſerved your ſelf in <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Commentaries, that the <hi>Romans</hi> commanded by that great Man, have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued the <hi>Gauls,</hi> but more yet by their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes and Stratagems in the Military Art, than by their Valour.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Macedonians,</hi> who were ſo jealous of keeping up the antient Order of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia formed by <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> thought their <hi>Phalanx</hi> invincible, and they
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:56382:264"/> could not be perſuaded that human Wit was capable of finding any thing out that was more firm and ſtrong. And yet the ſame <hi>Polybius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Polyb. <hi>17.</hi> in excerp. c. <hi>24,</hi> &amp; ſeq. Tit. Liv. <hi>9. 19. 31. 39,</hi> &amp;c.</note> and <hi>Titus Livius</hi> alter him have demonſtrated, that only by conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the nature of the <hi>Roman</hi> Armies, and thoſe of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> the latter could not fail of being beaten at the laſt, becauſe the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Phalanx, which was but a great four ſquare Battalion, very thick eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, could not move but all of a piece, whereas the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, divided into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral little Bodies, was more ready, active, and diſpoſed for all ſorts of Motions.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> therefore found, or elſe quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learnt the Art of dividing their Armies into many Battalions, and Squadrons, and of forming Bodies of Reſerve, whoſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſo proper for either puſhing on, or ſupporting what Side ſoever they ſaw to fail. Make the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Phalanx to march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Troops that were ſo diſpoſed and ordered; that heavy groſs Machine 'tis true, would be terrible to any Army on which it ſhould fall with all its weight; but as <hi>Polybius</hi> ſpeaks, it can never long preſerve its natural Propriety, that is to ſay, its Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and Conſiſtence, becauſe it will want proper Places, and as I may ſay, manifeſt Atchievements, and for want of finding them, it will confound it ſelf, or rather break by its own Motion. Add likewiſe that being once ruſhed in upon, it can never rally more: Whereas the <hi>Roman</hi> Army being divided into ſuch little Bodies, can make uſe of all places, and get their Advantages by them
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:56382:264"/> They unite, or ſeparate as they pleaſe; then unrank eaſily, and come together again with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any trouble. They are ready for detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for rallying, for all manner of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and changes as they ſee are neceſſary to be made, either in their whole Body, or any part of it. In a word, they have more diverſity of Motions, and conſequently more of action and force than the <hi>Phalanx.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may conclude with <hi>Polybius,</hi> that the <hi>Phalanx</hi> muſt needs yield to the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, and that the <hi>Macedonian</hi> muſt be overcome.</p>
               <p>It is very delightful, to diſcourſe with your Highneſs of thoſe things you have been ſo well inſtructed in by excellent Maſters, and which you ſee practiſed under the orders of <hi>Louis</hi> the Great, in ſo admirable a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that I know not whether the <hi>Roman</hi> Militia ever had any thing more fine and perfect. But not to diſpute it here with the <hi>French</hi> Militia, I ſhall content my ſelf with ſhewing you, that the Militia of <hi>Rome,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you look on the Science it ſelf of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king its advantages, or ſeriouſly conſider the extream Severity, in making all the orders and rules to be obſerved; I ſay it hath by much ſurpaſſed all that ever has been ſeen in the Precedent Ages.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Macedonia,</hi> 'tis needleſs to ſpeak any more of <hi>Greece:</hi> You have ſeen that <hi>Macedonia</hi> prevailed over it, and that may teach you to judg of the reſt. <hi>Athens</hi> hath produced nothing more ſince <hi>Alexander</hi>'s time. The <hi>Etolians,</hi> who had ſignalized themſelves in ſeveral Wars, were rather ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:56382:265"/> than free, and rather brutal than valiant. <hi>Lacedemonia</hi> had made her laſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for War, in producing <hi>Cleomenes;</hi> and the league of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> in producing <hi>Philopaemen.

                  <note place="margin">Plut. in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop.</note> by ſeeing the actions of the <hi>Romans</hi> in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> judged very rightly that the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of <hi>Greece</hi> was then upon the point of expiring, and that he had nothing more to do, but to retreat juſt at the time of its fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.

               <p>One of the braveſt things in the <hi>Roman</hi> Militia was, that falſe Valour was never commended in it.

               <p>A long Experience had taught the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> that from thence came forth all the Councils that had ſaved the State. It was in the Senate that lodged were the ancient Maxims, and the Wit and Spirit, as I may ſay, of the Republick.

               <p>It was in the worſt eſtate of the Republick,<note place="margin">Dion. Halic. <hi>8.</hi> Tit. Liv. <hi>2.39.</hi>
                  </note> when weak yet, and in its Birth ſhe ſaw her ſelf abſolutely both divided within by the Tribunes, and preſt hard without by the <hi>Volſci,</hi> whom incenſed <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> brought againſt his Country.

They were always more treatable when vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious, than when conquered, ſo well did the Senate know how to maintain the antient Maxims of the Commonwealth, and ſo well alſo did they know how to confirm the reſt of the Citizens in them.</p>
               <p>From the ſame Spirit likewiſe were thoſe Reſolutions taken in the Senate, of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming their Enemies by open Force, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out uſing Tricks or Stratagems, even thoſe that were permitted in War: Which the Senate did not out of a falſe Point of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, nor becauſe they were ignorant of the Laws of War; but becauſe they deemed

               <p>Thus was that high Opinion of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Arms eſtabliſhed throughout all the World.

               <p>The Conduct of the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate, ſo mighty and prevalent over their Enemies, was no leſs admirable in their Conduct of the State within.

               <p>The Senate ſhewed by that Ordinance that they underſtood wherein the true Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of a State conſiſted; and ſo generous a Sentiment joined to the Teſtimonies of a paternal Goodneſs, wrought ſuch an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the Breaſts of the People, that they

               <p>But when the People deſerved Blame, the Senate gave it them likewiſe with a Gravity and Courage worthy of ſo wiſe a Company; as it happened in the Controverſie between the <hi>Ardeates</hi> and <hi>Aricines.</hi> The Hiſtory of it is very memorable, and deſerves here to be told you.

The Tribes were aſſembled, and the People being made acquainted that thoſe Lands pretended to by others, of right belonged to them, adjudged them for themſelves. The Senate, altho' they were convinced that the People had in the main made a right Judgment, yet they could not indure that the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould derogate from their natural Generoſity, nor that they ſhould baſely have deceived the Hopes of their Neighbours who had ſubmitted to their Award. There was nothing left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attempted that could be done to hinder a Judgment of ſo pernicious an Example, where the Judges took for themſelves the Lands that were in diſpute between the ſaid Parties. After that the Sentence had been given, the <hi>Ardeates,</hi> whoſe Right was moſt apparent, being incenſed at ſo wicked a Judgment, were ready to revenge themſelves by Arms. The Senate, without any more
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:56382:268"/> adoe, publickly declared to them that they were as ſenſible as themſelves of the Injury which had been done them, but in truth they could not quaſh a Decree made by the People; but that if after that Offence they would be willing to rely upon their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany for Reparation, which they had great reaſon to expect, the Senate would take that Care to ſatisfy them, that they ſhould have no cauſe of further Complaint. The <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deates</hi> relyed on their word. It was ſuch an Affair that had like utterly to have ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined their City. But they received ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate a Relief by the Orders of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that they reckoned themſelves very well paid for the Land which had been taken away from them, and they were then ſtudying how to pay their Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſuch faithful Friends. But the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate was not ſatisfied, until by their making the Land be reſtored which the People of <hi>Rome</hi> had adjudged for themſelves, they aboliſhed the Memory of ſo infamous a Judgment.</p>
               <p>I do not undertake here to tell you how the Senate had likewiſe done ſeveral ſuch Actions;<note place="margin">Pal. Tit. Liv. Cic. de Off. <hi>3.</hi> &amp;c.</note> how often they have delivered to their Enemies perjured Citizens that would not keep their word with them, or that plaid Tricks with their Oaths; how often they condemned evil Councils, although they had met with happy Succeſſes; I ſhall only tell you that that auguſt Company inſpired nothing but what was great into the <hi>Roman</hi> People, and upon all Occaſions gave a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high Idea of their Councils, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:56382:269"/> that the Reputation was ſtrongeſt which was ſtrengthened by the States.</p>
               <p>'Tis eaſy to be believed that by a People ſo wiſely directed, Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were aſſigned with great Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Beſides that the Service and Zeal for the Weal publick, were the ſureſt means to raiſe them up to the firſt Offices in it: The Military Actions had a thouſand Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences which coſt the Publick nothing, and which were extreamly eſteemed by private Perſons; becauſe thereby they had confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon them that Honour which was ſo dear to that martial and warlike People. A Crown of very fine Gold, and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly a Crown of Oak Leaves, or of Laurel, or ſome Herb or other that is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler yet, was of ineſtimable Price among Souldiers that knew no marks more glorious than thoſe of Vertue, nor no Diſtinction more noble than that which came from He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Actions.</p>
               <p>The Senate, whoſe Approbation was the ſame thing as Reward, underſtood very well how to commend and how to blame when there was occaſion. Immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Fighting, the Conſuls and the other Generals publickly gave to the Souldiers and to the Officers, the Praiſe or the Blame as they deſerved: But for themſelves they doubtfully waited for the Judgment of the Senate, which judged by the Wiſdom of their Councils, and not ſuffered themſelves to be dazeled by the Happineſs of Events. Their Commendations were highly valued, becauſe they were given with Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:56382:269"/> Their Reprimands went to the Hearts of the Free and Generous, and kept the more Weak in their Duty. The Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which followed ill Actions, kept the Souldiers in fear, while in the mean time, Rewards and Honours well diſpenſed raiſed them above themſelves.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who can inſpire into Peoples Minds Glory, patience of Labours, the Grandeur of the Nation, and the Love of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, may truly boaſt they have found out the moſt proper Conſtitution of State to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce great Men. 'Tis without doubt great Men that make the Power of an Empire. Nature doth never fail to bring forth in all Nations exalted Minds and Courages, but yet they want the Aſſiſtance of being better formed and cultivated. That which forms them, and that which compleats 'em, are ſtrong Sentiments and noble Impreſſions, which are ſcattered in all Minds, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly paſs from one to the other. What is it makes our Nobles ſo bold in fight, and ſo daring in their enterpriſes? 'Tis an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion receiv'd at their Infancy, and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the unanimous ſentiment of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that a Cowardly Gentleman degrades himſelf, and is not worthy to enjoy the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Air. All the <hi>Romans</hi> were bred up in that Opinion, and the People diſputed with the Nobles who ſhould be the briskeſt Actors upon thoſe vigorous Maxims. Whilſt <hi>Rome</hi> was at Peace, the very Infancy was exercis'd in hardſhips; there was nothing elſe heard diſcours'd of but the greatneſs of the <hi>Roman</hi> Name. They were obliged to go to the
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:56382:270" rendition="simple:additions"/> War whenever the Republick required it, and there to work perpetually, to Camp Winter and Summer, to Obey without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, to Dy or Conquer. Thoſe Fathers who brought not up their Children in thoſe Maxims, and as they ought, to make them capable of ſerving the State, were Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to Juſtice, by the Magiſtrates, and judg'd guilty of an attempt againſt the Publick. When this way was firſt begun to be taken, the great Men help'd to make one another ſo: And if <hi>Rome</hi> hath bred more of them than any other City whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of greater Antiquity, it hath not been by accident; but becauſe the <hi>Roman</hi> State, being conſtituted ſo as we have ſeen it, was, as I may ſay, of a Temperament likely to be moſt fruitful in Hero's.</p>
               <p>A Government that finds it ſelf thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, finds it ſelf at the ſame time of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable ſtrength, and never fancies it ſelf without Recruit.

               <p>'Twas then that the Conſul <hi>Terentius Varro,</hi> who was but juſt come from loſing, through his own Fault, ſo great a Battle, was received at <hi>Rome</hi> as if he had been Victorious, becauſe only even in that very great Unhappineſs he did not deſpair of the Affairs of the Republick. The Senate gave him their publick Thanks for it, and then they reſolved, according to their old Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims, not in that ſad deplorable Eſtate to hearken to any Propoſition of Peace. The Enemy was aſtoniſhed; the People took Heart afreſh, and believed they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ad new Recruits which the Senate knew of by their prudence.</p>
               <p>In fine, the conſtancy of the Senate, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt ſo many miſchiefs that happened one on the heels of another, proceeded not only from an obſtinate reſolution that they would never yield to Fortune, but from a profound knowledge of the <hi>Roman</hi> Forces, and of thoſe of their Enemies. <hi>Rome</hi> knew by her <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> that is to ſay, by the Roll of her Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens evermore exactly continued from the time of <hi>Servius Tullius;</hi> ſhe knew, I ſay, all her number of Citizens that were capable of bearing Arms, and what her expectations could be of the Youth which were growing up every day. Thus ſhe managed her For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt an Enemy that came from the Borders of <hi>Africa;</hi> that time would deſtroy every Man of them in a ſtrange Country, where Succors were ſo tardy; and to whom their very Victories, which coſt them ſo much Blood, were fatal. Wherefore, what ever loſs happened, the Senate always being
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:56382:271"/> informed what good Soldiers remained, as alſo who protracted their time; and never ſuffered them to be diſcomfited. When by the defeat at <hi>Canna,</hi> and by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volts that followed, they ſaw the Forces of the Commonwealth ſo weakened, that they could have ſcarce defended themſelves if the Enemy had preſſed them, they kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up by their Courage, and without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing troubled for their loſſes, they ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to watch the motions of the Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.

                  </hi> inſtead of purſuing his Victory, for ſome time only thought how he might enjoy it, the Senate were ſecure, for they fully ſaw that an Enemy who was capable of breaking his Fortune, and letting himſelf be dazled with his great Succeſſes, was not born to overcome the <hi>Romans.</hi> From that time <hi>Rome</hi> made great Enterpriſes every day; and <hi>Hannibal</hi> as couragious and victorious as he was, could not hold up againſt her.</p>
               <p>'Tis eaſy to judge by that ſingle event to whom at laſt all the Advantage was likely to come. <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſwollen with his mighty Succeſſes, thought the taking of <hi>Rome</hi> was very eaſy, and therefore gave himſelf ſome intermiſſion. <hi>Rome</hi> in the midſt of all her Calamities, neither loſt her Courage nor her Confidence, and undertook greater things than ever.

               <p>And if the <hi>Romans</hi> made uſe of thoſe great Politick and Military Qualities, only to preſerve their State in Peace, or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect their oppreſt Allies, as they made ſuch a pretenſion to do, we muſt as much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their Equity, as their Valour and their Prudence. But when they had taſted the ſweetneſs of Victory, they then reſolved to make every thing yield to them, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:56382:273"/> to nothing leſs than to put firſt their Neighbours, and afterwards all the World under their Laws.</p>
               <p>To attain that end, they perfectly knew how to preſerve their Allies, to unite them among themſelves, to throw diviſion and jealouſie among their Enemies, to penetrate into their Councils, to diſcover their Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences, and to prevent their Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings.</p>
               <p>They not only obſerved the marches of their Enemies, but alſo all the Progreſſes of their Neighbours; and they were above all things curious either in dividing, or in Counter-balancing by ſome other way the powers that became too formidable, or which put too great obſtacles to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts.</p>
               <p>Therefore the <hi>Greeks</hi> were to blame for imagining in the time of <hi>Polybius,</hi>

                     <hi>Polyb.</hi> 1.63.</note> that <hi>Rome</hi> aggrandized her ſelf rather by hazard than by conduct: they were too fond of their own Nation, and too jealous of thoſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they ſaw raiſed above them: Or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure that ſeeing at a diſtance the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire to advance ſo quickly, without penetrating into the Councils which ordered the motions of that great Body, they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to chance, as the cuſtom of Men is, the Effects of which the Cauſes were not known to them. But <hi>Polybius</hi> whoſe ſtrict familiarity with the <hi>Romans</hi> made him get ſo far into the ſecret of Affairs, and nearly to obſerve the <hi>Roman</hi> Polity during the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Wars, hath been more juſt and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table than the other <hi>Greeks,</hi> and hath ſeen

               <p>And when they had overcome 'em, by a publick Decree to reſtore to <hi>Greece</hi> which had been ſo long Captivated, that Liberty which they never dream'd of; by that means to ſcatter on one hand Terrour, and on the other a Veneration for their Name: All theſe are enough for any one to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That the <hi>Romans</hi> never got the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the World by hazard but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>
               <p>This is what <hi>Polybius</hi> ſaw in the time of <hi>Rome</hi>'s progreſſes.<note place="margin">Dion. Halic. Ant. Rom. <hi>1.2.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But the more of deſign thoſe Hiſtorians diſcover in the Conqueſts of <hi>Rome,</hi> the more Injuſtice do they ſhew in them. That is a vice inſeparable from the deſire of Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which alſo for that reaſon is juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Rules of the Goſpel.

               <p>'Tis true, they appeared pretty equitable at the beginning of their Republick.

That Council was ſet up to judge whether a War was juſt or no: Before the Senate propoſed it, or the People reſolved on it, that <hi>Examen</hi> of Equity always preceded. When the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the War was known, the Senate conſulted about the meaſures how they were to have it undertaken: But firſt of all they
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:56382:274"/> ſent to the Uſurper in all Formalities to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demand of him the things he had unjuſtly raviſhed, and they never went to extremities, till after they had tryed all the ways of Gentleneſs, and Candour. A holy Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this, if ever there was one, and which may ſhame Chriſtians, in whom God-man that came into the World to pacifie all things, hath not been able to inſpire Charity and Peace. But what do ſignifie the beſt Inſtitutions, when at laſt they degenerate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to pure Ceremonies? The charms of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering, and of abſolute Commanding did ſoon corrupt in the <hi>Romans</hi> that right which natural Equity had given them. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations of the <hi>Faeciales</hi> were only a uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Formality among them; and though they uſed towards their greateſt Enemies acts of extraordinary moderation and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, yet ambition did not ſuffer Juſtice to prevail in their Councils.</p>
               <p>But their Injuſtices were ſo much the more dangerous, as they knew better how to cover them under the ſpecious pretext of Equity, and as they inſenſibly brought Kings and Nations under their Yoke, under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of protecting and defending them.</p>
               <p>Let us add alſo, that they were cruel to thoſe who reſiſted them: Another quality prety natural to Conquerors, who knows that fear makes more than half to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts. But is Dominion to be had at that rate, and to Command is that ſo pleaſing to make Men purchaſe it by ſuch inhumane actions? The <hi>Romans,</hi> to make every place afraid of them, affected to leave in their
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:56382:275"/> conquered Towns terrible Spectacles of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, and to appear unmerciful to thoſe who would be forced, without ſo much as ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Kings,<note place="margin">

               <p>But if they were cruel and unjuſt for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering, yet they governed the ſubdued Nati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns with moderation. They endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to make the ſubjected People ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their Government, and they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that that was their beſt means to ſecure them their Conqueſts. The Senate kept ſhort the Governours, and did Juſtice to the People. That Company was looked on as the <hi>Aſylum</hi> of the oppreſſed; alſo the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſions and violences were not known among the <hi>Romans</hi> but in the laſt times of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, and the retention of their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates was the admiration of the World.</p>
               <p>It was not therefore of thoſe brutal and avaritious Conquerors, who were only gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Pillage, or who eſtabliſhed their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination upon the ruine of vanquiſh'd Countries. The <hi>Romans</hi> made all thoſe whom they took, better by cauſing Juſtice to flouriſh in them, Agriculture, Commerce, and even Arts and Sciences too, after they had once been made ſenſible of them.</p>
               <p>'Twas that which gave them the moſt flouriſhing, and the beſt eſtabliſhed as well as the moſt extenſive Empire that ever was. From <hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Tanaus</hi> even to <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> his Pillars, and the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Sea, all Lands and Seas obeyed them: From the
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:56382:275"/> middle, and as it were the Center of the Mediterranean Sea, they had all the extent of that Sea, penetrating into both the length and breadth of all the Kingdoms round thereabouts, and keeping it between two to make the Communication of their Empire. It is enough ſtill to aſtoniſh one when he conſiders that the Nations which at this day make ſuch great and redoubted Kingdoms, all the <hi>Gauls,</hi> all <hi>Spain, Great Britain</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt entirely, <hi>Illyricum</hi> even to the <hi>Danube, Germany</hi> to the <hi>Elbe, Africk</hi> to its frightful and impenetrable Deſarts, <hi>Greece, Thracia, Syria, Egypt,</hi> all the Kingdoms of <hi>Leſſer Aſia,</hi> and thoſe which are ſhut up between the <hi>Euxine</hi> and the <hi>Caſpian Sea,</hi> and the reſt which poſſibly I may forget, or am not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to mention, have been for many Ages but <hi>Roman</hi> Provinces. All the People of our World, even to the moſt Barbarous, have reſpected their Power, and the <hi>Romans</hi> eſtabliſhed in them almoſt every where with their Empire their Laws and their Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
               <p>'Tis a kind of a Prodigv, that in ſo vaſt an Empire, which reached over ſo many Nations and Kingdoms, the People ſhould be ſo obedient, and that Revolts ſhould be ſo ſeldom. The <hi>Roman</hi> Polity had taken care of it by divers ways, which it will not be amiſs briefly to explain to your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Colonies eſtabliſhed on all ſides in the Empire, wrought two admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effects: the One was to diſcharge the City of a great number of Citizens, and the
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:56382:276"/> moſt part of them poor; the other, to keep the principal Poſts, and by degrees to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtome ſtrange People to the <hi>Roman</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Colonies which carried with them their Priviledges, remained always attached to the Body of the Republick, and populated all the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
               <p>But beſides Colonies, a great many Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties obtained for their Citizens the priviledge of <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens; and being by their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt united to the commanding People, they kept the neighbouring Cities in their duty.</p>
               <p>It happened at laſt that all the Subjects of the Empires believ'd themſelves <hi>Romans.</hi> The Honours of the Victorious People by little and little were communicated to the conquered People, the Senate was open to them, and they could aſpire even to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Thus by the <hi>Roman</hi> Clemency, all the Nations were but as one ſingle Nation, and <hi>Rome</hi> was looked on as the common Country.</p>
               <p>What Facility did not that marvellous u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all the People of the World, under one and the ſame Empire, bring to Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Commerce. The <hi>Roman</hi> Society embraced all, and excepting ſome Frontiers now and then diſturbed by their Neighbours, all the reſt of the Univerſe enjoyed a moſt profound Peace. Neither <hi>Greece</hi> nor leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> nor <hi>Syria,</hi> nor <hi>Egypt,</hi> nor to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, ſcarce were any of the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces ever without War, but under the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and it is eaſy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:56382:276"/> that ſo pleaſant a Commerce of the Nations held to keep throughout the whole Body of the Empire Concord and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>The Legions divided for the Guard of the Frontiers, by defending thoſe without, ſtrengthned thoſe that were within. 'Twas not the Cuſtom of the <hi>Romans</hi> to have Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dells in their Holds, nor to fortify their fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, and I ſcarce find when that Care began, but in <hi>Valentinian</hi> the firſt's time. Before then the Strength and Security of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was ſolely placed in the Troops, which they diſpoſed in that manner, that they mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually aſſiſted each other Now as it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that they ſhould be always encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Cities were not incommoded by it; and the Diſcipline did not ſuffer any of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to diſperſe themſelves into the open Fields. By that means the <hi>Roman</hi> Armies neither troubled commerce nor tillage. Their Camps were to them in the nature of Cities, which differed little from others, but becauſe they were there in continual Exerciſes, their Diſcipline more ſevere, and their Command more reſolute. They were always ready for the leaſt Motion, and it was ſufficient to keep the People in their Duty, to ſhew them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Vicinage that invincible Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia.</p>
               <p>But nothing ſo much maintained the Peace of the Empire, as the order of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. The ancient Republick had eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; the Emperors and the Sages had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained it upon the ſame Foundations: all the People, even the moſt Barbarous, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:56382:277"/> on them with admiration; and by that principally the <hi>Romans</hi> were judged worthy to be the Maſters of the World. Now if the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws have appeared ſo ſacred, that their Majeſty continues ſtill, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ruin of the Empire; it was becauſe their good Sence, which is the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs of humane Life, was ſeen every where in them, and there was no where ſeen a more delicate and fairer application of the Principles of natural Equity.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding all that greatneſs of the <hi>Roman</hi> Name, notwithſtanding her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Polity, and all the fine Inſtititutions of that famous Republick, ſhe yet carried in her own Breaſt the cauſe of her ruine, in the perpetual Jealouſie of the People againſt the Senate, or rather of the <hi>Plebeians</hi> againſt the <hi>Patricii. Romulus</hi> had ſet up that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction. It was neceſſary for Kings to have perſons diſtinguiſhed whom they ſhould engage to their Perſon by particular Bonds, and by whom they ſhould govern the reſt of the People.<note place="margin">Dion. Hal. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> Therefore did <hi>Romulus</hi> chooſe the Fathers, of whom he formed the Body of the Senate. They called them ſo, by reaſon of their Dignity, and their Age. And from them afterwards ſprung the Patrician Families. Now whatſoever Authority <hi>Romulus</hi> had reſerved to the People, he had put the <hi>Plebeians</hi> in divers reſpects in a dependance on the <hi>Patricii;</hi> and that ſubordination neceſſary to Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had been preſerved not only under Kings; but alſo in the Republick. It was always from the <hi>Patricii</hi> that the Senators were
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:56382:277"/>made. To the <hi>Patricii</hi> belonged the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, Commands, Dignities, and even that of the Prieſthood and the Fathers, who had been the Authors of Liberty, did not quit their Prerogatives. But Jealouſy was quickly put between thoſe two orders. For I need not here ſpeak of the <hi>Roman</hi> Knights, a third order as being in common between the <hi>Patricii</hi> and the ſimple People, who eſpouſed ſometimes one ſide and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times another. It was therefore between thoſe two orders that Jealouſy a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oſe: It was provoked upon divers occaſions, but the chief cauſe of all which kept it up, was their love of Liberty.</p>
               <p>The fundamental Maxim of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, was to look upon Liberty as a thing inſeparable from the <hi>Roman</hi> Name. A Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple bred up in that Mind; nay more, a People who thought themſelves born for commanding other People, and whom <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> for that reaſon ſo nobly calls a Kinglike People, would receive no Laws but from their own ſelves.</p>
               <p>The Authority of the Senate was judged neceſſary for the moderating of publick Councils, which without that temperature would have been too tumultuous. But at the bottom it was the Peoples Province to give commands, to make Laws, to decide Peace and War. A People that enjoyed the moſt eſſential Rights of Royalty, in ſome manner were of the Temper of Kings. They were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receive grave advices, but they would not be forced by the Senate. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſeemed too imperious, every thing
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:56382:278"/> that was too highly advanced: in a word, whatſoever wounded or was likely to wound that Equality which a free State required, gave ſuſpicion to ſo nice and delicate a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The love of Liberty, that of Glory and Conqueſts, made ſuch Spirits very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be managed, and that daring au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacity, which made them attempt all things abroad, could not fail to cauſe diviſions at home among themſelves.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Romulus</hi> bred up in War, and reputed the Son of <hi>Mars,</hi> built <hi>Rome,</hi> which he po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated with an amaſſed Company of Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, Slaves, Robbers, who came to ſeek for freedom and impunity in the Iſle he had laid open for all Comers; and ſome alſo came that were better qualified, and more Civilized.</p>
               <p>He bred up that People wild in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to undertake all things by force, and by that means they got themſelves Wives, whom they Married.</p>

                  </note> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained luxurious Minds by moſt ſacred Laws, he began by Religion, which he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on as the Foundation of all States. He made it as ſerious, as grave, and as modeſt as the Darkneſſes of Idolatry could then permit him. Strange Religions and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, which were not eſtabliſhed by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Cuſtoms were forbidden. Afterwards that Law was diſpenſed; but the intention
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:56382:279"/> of. <hi>Romulus</hi> was, that it ſhould be kept, and ſomething of it was always retained.</p>
               <p>He choſe out of all that number of People, the better ſort, to form the publick Council, which he called the Senate: He made it to conſiſt of two hundred Senators, whoſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was likewiſe afterwards augmented; and from them came the noble Families that were called the <hi>Patricii.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Senate was to examine and propoſe all matters; ſome of them it regulated So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignly with the King; but the moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral were referred to the People, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided them.</p>

               <p>To appeaſe the People who loved their Prince, and to give a great Idea of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that City, the Senators proclaimed that the Gods had ſnatched him up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and cauſed Altars to be erected to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> the ſecond King, in a long and profound Peace, compleated the formation of their Manners, and the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of Religion upon the ſame foundations which <hi>Romulus</hi> had laid.</p>

               <p>After him <hi>Tarquin</hi> the Antient, to make Creatures to himſelf, encreaſed the number of the Senators to three Hundred, where they ſtuck fixed for ſome Ages, and began the great Works which were to conduce to the Publick weal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Servius Tullius</hi> projected the ſetting up a Republick under the command of two annual Magiſtrates, which ſhould be choſen by the People.</p>
               <p>In hatred to <hi>Tarquin</hi> the proud, the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty was aboliſhed with horrible Execrations againſt all thoſe who ſhould go about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh it, and <hi>Brutus</hi> made the People to ſwear to keep themſelves eternally in their Liberty.</p>
               <p>The Memoires of <hi>Servius Tullius</hi> were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in that Change. The Conſuls cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by the People among the <hi>Patricii,</hi> were equalled to Kings, excepting that they were two who had between them a regular turn of Commanding, and they changed every Year.</p>

               <p>By that new Law, the Conſular Power was weakened in its Origine, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple enlarged their Rights.</p>
               <p>By reaſon of the Violences executed for Debt by the Rich upon the Poor, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that riſe up againſt the Power of the Conſuls and Senate, made that famous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat at the Mount <hi>Aventinus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was nothing but Liberty ſpoke of in thoſe Aſſemblies, and the People of <hi>Rome</hi> did not believe themſelves to be free,<note place="margin">Dion. Hal. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> if they had not lawful Ways of reſiſting the Senate. They were forced to allow them particular Magiſtrates called the Tribunes of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which might aſſemble them, and help them againſt the Authority of the Conſuls, either by Oppoſition or Appeal.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Magiſtrates, to keep up their own Authority, were continually buzzing of Jealouſies, and creating Diviſions between thoſe two Orders, and always were flattering the People, by propoſing that the Lands of the Conquered Countries, or the Price that would be the product of their Sale, ſhould be divided among the Citizens.</p>
               <p>The Senate with great Zeal and Earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs perpetually oppoſed thoſe Laws that
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:56382:280"/> would be ſo ruinous to the State, and would have the Price of thoſe Lands adjudged to be put into the publick Treaſury.</p>
               <p>The People ſuffered themſelves to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by their ſeditious Magiſtrates, and yet had notwithſtanding ſo much Reaſon and Equity as to admire the Vertue of the great Men that reſiſted them.</p>
               <p>Againſt thoſe domeſtick Diſſenſions, the Senate found no better Remedy than to be continually raiſing Occaſions for foreign Wars. They prevented thoſe Diviſions from being puſhed on to Extremity, and reunited thoſe Orders in the Defence of their Country.</p>
               <p>Whileſt Wars ſucceeded, and Conqueſts increaſed, Jealouſies were ſtill kept awake.</p>
               <p>The two Parties wearied by the many Diviſions which threatned the Ruine of the State, agreed to the making of ſuch Laws as might be for the quiet of them both, and to eſtabliſh the Equality which ought to be in a free City.</p>
               <p>Each of the Orders pretended that the eſtabliſhment of thoſe Laws belonged to them.</p>
               <p>Jealouſie increaſed by thoſe Pretenſions, made them to reſolve by common Conſent to ſend an Embaſſy into <hi>Greece</hi> to ſearch therefor the Inſtitutions of the Cities of that Country, and eſpecially for the Laws of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> which were the moſt popular. The Laws of the twelve Tables were eſtabliſhed, and the <hi>Decemviri,</hi> who digeſted them, were deprived of the Power which they abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <pb n="548" facs="tcp:56382:281"/>
               <p>Whileſt every thing appeared placid and tranquil, and that ſuch equitable Laws ſeem'd eternally to eſtabliſh the publick Repoſe, Diſſentions ſtarted up again by new Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the People who aſpired to Honours and to the Conſulate which till then were reſerved only to the firſt Order.</p>
               <p>The Law to admit them to them was propounded. Rather than to have the Conſulate pulled down, the Fathers conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Creation of three new Magiſtrates, who ſhould have the Authority of Conſuls under the Name of Military Tribunes, and the People were admitted to that Honour.</p>
               <p>Being contented to have their Right e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed, they uſed moderately their Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and continued ſometimes in giving the Command to the <hi>Patricii</hi> only.</p>
               <p>After long and various Diſputes they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Conſulate, and by degrees the Honours became common between the two Orders, tho' the <hi>Patricii</hi> were always the moſt conſidered in the Elections.</p>
               <p>The Wars continued, and the <hi>Romans</hi> ſubjected after five hundred Years the <hi>Gaules Ciſalpines,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">App. praef. Ep.</note> their principal Enemies, and all <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There began to <hi>Punick</hi> Wars; and things went on ſo forward, that each of thoſe two jealous People believed they could not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt but by the Ruine of the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> ready to fall, was chiefly kept up during her Misfortunes by the Conſtancy and Wiſdom of the Senate.</p>
               <p>At laſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Patience got the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; <hi>Hannibal</hi> was overcome, and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi>
                  <pb n="549" facs="tcp:56382:281"/> ſubjugated by <hi>Scipio Africanus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Victorious <hi>Rome</hi> enlarged her ſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly for two hundred Years both by Sea and by Land, and reduced all the World under her Power.</p>
               <p>In thoſe times, and ſince the Ruine of <hi>Carthage,</hi> the Offices, whoſe Dignity as well as Profit, increaſed with the Empire, were underhand furiouſly laboured for. The Ambitious Pretenders took care only to flatter the People, and the concord of the Orders held up by the Buſineſs of the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> Wars was troubled more than ever. The <hi>Gracchi</hi> put all things into Confuſion, and their ſeditious Propoſitions were the beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nning of all the Civil Wars.</p>
               <p>Then began they to bear Arms, and by open Force to act in the Aſſemblies of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, where before every one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired only to carry it by lawful Ways, and with Liberty of Opinions.</p>
               <p>The wiſe Conduct of the Senate, and the great Wars happening, moderated their Diſorders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marius</hi> the <hi>Plebeian,</hi> a great Man of War, with his military Eloquence, and his ſeditious Harangues, wherewith he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually attacking the Pride of the Nobles, awakened the Peoples Jealouſies, and by that means raiſed himſelf to the greateſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sylla</hi> a Patrician, put himſelf at the Head of the contrary Party, and became the Object of <hi>Marius</hi> his Jealouſie.</p>
               <p>Factions and Corruptions could do all things in <hi>Rome.</hi> The Love of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:56382:282"/> and deference to their Laws, were quite extinguiſhed there.</p>
               <p>And to compleat their Miſeries, the Wars of <hi>Aſia</hi> taught the <hi>Romans</hi> Luxury, and increaſed their Ava<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Then the Generals began to joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their Souldiers, who till that time ſaw nothing but the Character of publick Authority in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sylla,</hi> in the War againſt <hi>Mithridates,</hi> let his Souldiers enrich themſelves the better to gain them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marius,</hi> on his ſide, propoſed to his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates the Shares of both Money and Lands.</p>
               <p>By that means being Maſters of their Troops, the one under pretence of ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Senate, and the other under the name of the People, they made a moſt fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious War even in tne Heart of the City.</p>
               <p>The Party of <hi>Marius</hi> and of the People were utterly beaten, and <hi>Sylla</hi> made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Soveraign under the Name of Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
               <p>He made moſt dreadful Slaughters, and treated the People with Severity both in Deeds and Words, even in their lawful Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies.</p>
               <p>Being more Puiſſant and better eſtabliſhed than ever, he retreated to a private Life, but it was after he had ſhewn that the <hi>Romans</hi> could indure a Maſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pompey,</hi> whom <hi>Sylla</hi> had raiſed, ſucceded to a great part of his Power. He flattered ſometimes the People, and ſometimes the Senate to get himſelf eſtabliſhed: But his
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:56382:282"/> Inclination and Intereſt at length fixed him to the latter.</p>
               <p>Being a Conqueror of the Pyrates of <hi>Spain</hi> and all the Eaſt, he became very puiſſant in the Republick, and in the Senate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who was reſolved at leaſt to be his Equal, turned to the People's ſide, and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating in his Conſulate the moſt ſeditious Tribunes, he propoſed with the Diviſions of the Land, the moſt popular Laws he could invent.</p>
               <p>The Conqueſt of the <hi>Gaules</hi> brought the Glory and Power of <hi>Caeſar</hi> to the higheſt Pitch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> and he were united thro' Intereſt, and afterwards broke again thro' Jealouſie. The Civil War began to kindle. <hi>Pompey</hi> thought that his Name alone would carry all, and ſo neglected himſelf. <hi>Caeſar</hi> active and diſcerning obtained the Victory, and got the Maſtery of him.</p>
               <p>He made ſeveral Attempts to ſee whether the <hi>Romans</hi> could be brought to uſe the name of King. But they only ſerved to make him odious. To increaſe the publick Hatred, the Senate decreed him Honours until then unheard of in <hi>

               <p>The Senate ſignified nothing any longer: All things were done by Force, and Souldiers, who were at their Service that would give 'em moſt.</p>
               <p>In that fatal Conjuncture the Triumvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate deſtroyed all thoſe whom <hi>Rome</hi> had bred up, that were of greateſt Courage and moſt oppoſite to Tyranny. <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> defeated <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius:</hi> Liberty expired with them.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rome</hi> being weary and exhauſted by ſo many civil Wars, to get ſome Repoſe, was forced to renounce her Liberty.</p>
               <p>The Houſe of the <hi>Caeſars</hi> fixed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Armies under the name of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and exerciſed an abſolute Power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rome</hi> under the <hi>Caeſars</hi> being more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:56382:283"/> to preſerve than to enlarge her ſelf, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made any more Conqueſts than to drive away the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who would fain have got into the Empire.</p>
               <p>At the Death of <hi>Caligula,</hi> the Senate then upon the point or re-eſtabliſhing Liberty, and the Conſular Power, were prevented by the Souldiers, who would have a perpetual Head, and that their Head ſhould be the Maſter.</p>

               <p>They carried it ſo that they offered to ſell it publickly to him that would give moſt for't, and they uſe to ſhake the Yoke. With Obedience the Diſcipline was loſt. The good Princes indeavoured, but in vain, to preſerve it, and their Zeal to maintain the antient Order of the <hi>Roman</hi> Militia, ſerved only to expoſe them to the Fury of the Souldiers.</p>
               <p>In the Changes of Emperors, every Army labouring to prefer their own, occaſioned civil Wars, and horrid Maſſacres.</p>
               <p>Thus grew the Empire weak thro' the neglect of the Diſcipline, and was utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the many inteſtine Wars.</p>
               <p>In the midſt of thoſe manifold great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, the Fear and the Majeſty of the <hi>Roman</hi> Name waxed leſs and leſs. The <hi>Parthians</hi> ofen times overcome became for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable on the Eaſt ſide under the old Name of <hi>Perſians,</hi> which they again aſſumed. The Northern Nations, who inhabited the cold
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:56382:284"/> and uncultivated Lands, drawn by the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Riches of that of the Empire, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted always to make their Entry into it.</p>
               <p>One ſingle Man was not ſufficient any longer to ſuſtain the weight of the Empire which was ſo vaſt, and withal ſo ſtrongly attacked.</p>
               <p>The prodigious multitude of Wars, and the humor of the Souldiers, who were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to have Emperors and <hi>Caeſars</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct them, obliged 'em to multiply them.</p>
               <p>The Empire it ſelf being looked on as an hereditary good, the Emperors were natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally multiplied thro' the multitude of their Princes Children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> aſſociated his Brother to the Empire. <hi>Severus</hi> made his two Sons Emperors. The neceſſity of Affairs obliged <hi>Diocleſian</hi> to ſhare the Eaſt and the Weſt between him and <hi>Maximian:</hi> Each of them being overcharged, relieved themſelves by electing two <hi>Caeſars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thro' this multitude of Emperors and <hi>Caeſars,</hi> the Eſtate was ruined thro' the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Expence, the Body of the Empire was diſunited, and the civil Wars were multiplied.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> the Son of the Emperor <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius Chlorus,</hi> divided the Empire as an Heritage among his Children: Poſterity followed thoſe Examples, and there was ſcarce ever after ſeen one Empire.</p>
               <p>The Softneſs of <hi>Honorius,</hi> and that of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian</hi> III. Emperors of the Weſt, brought the Ruine of all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf were diverſe times
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:56382:284"/> ſacked and became the Prey of the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the <hi>Weſt</hi> was in Common. <hi>Aſrick</hi> was poſſeſſed by the <hi>Vandalls, Spain,</hi> by the <hi>Viſigoths, Gauls,</hi> by the <hi>Franks,</hi> Great <hi>Britain</hi> by the <hi>Saxons, Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> too, by the <hi>Heruli,</hi> and afterwards by the <hi>Oſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goths.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors ſhut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and left the reſt, even <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Empire reſumes ſome Strength under <hi>Juſtinian</hi> by the Valour of <hi>Beliſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and <hi>Narſus. Rome</hi> often taken and retaken, fell at laſt to the Emperors. The <hi>Saracens,</hi> become powerful by thee diviſion of their Neighbours, and by the careleſneſs of the Emperors, took from them the greateſt part of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and ſo tormented them on that ſide, that they no longer took care of <hi>Italy.</hi> The <hi>Lombards</hi> there poſſeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the richeſt and moſt beautiful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. <hi>Rome</hi> reduced to Extremity by their continual attacks, and having no defence from their Emperors, were forced to throw themſelves into the hands of the <hi>French.

               <p>'Tis eaſy for you now to know the cauſes of the Riſe and fall of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="556" facs="tcp:56382:285"/>
               <p>You ſee that that Kingdom founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on War, and thereby naturally diſpoſed to treſpaſs upon her Neighbours, hath put all the World under her Yoke, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Politic and the Military Art up to the higheſt Degree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>You ſee the cauſes of the diviſions of the Republick, and finally of its fall thro' the Jealouſies of the Citizens, and through the love of Liberty puſhed on even to an inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable exceſs and nicety.</p>
               <p>It is likewiſe as eaſy for you to diſtinguiſh all the times of <hi>Rome,</hi> whether you pleaſe to conſider her in her ſelf, or whether you look upon her in relation to other People; you ſee the Changes which were to follow the diſpoſition of affairs in each time.</p>
               <p>In her ſelf you ſee her at the beginning in a Monarchical State, eſtabliſhed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her primitive Laws, afterwards in Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and at laſt ſubjected once again to the Monarchic Government, but by force and violence.</p>
               <p>'Tis eaſy for you to conceive after what manner the popular Eſtate was formed, from the beginnings it had in the times of Royalty, and with as plain an Evidence will you ſee how in the time of Liberty the foundations of the new Monarchy, were by ſmall footſteps raiſed and Eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>For in the like manner, as you have ſeen the Project of a Republick laid in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, by <hi>Servius Tullius,</hi> who gave as it were the firſt relliſh of liberty to the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo have you alſo obſerved, that <hi>Sylla's</hi> Tyranny, though it was but very tranſitory,
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:56382:285"/> and ſhort, diſcovered that <hi>Rome,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding her fierceneſs, was as much ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of bearing the Yoke, as thoſe People whom ſhe kept under Servitude.</p>
               <p>To know what operation that furious Jealouſie between the Orders ſucceſſively had, you need only to diſtinguiſh the two times, which I have expreſly marked out to you: The one, when the People were retained within certain bounds, by the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers they were in on very ſide; and the other when having nothing more to fear from without, they abſolutely, without, any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, gave themſelves up to their Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>The eſſential Character of each of thoſe two times, is, that in the one the love of their Country, and of their Laws, ſwayed their Minds; and that in the other, all was decided by intereſt and force.</p>
               <p>From thence it happened alſo, that at the firſt of thoſe two times the Men of Command who aſpired after honours by lawful ways, kept the Soldiers in, and faſt to the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick: Whereas in the other time, when vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ruled all, they only thought how to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage them to get them into their Deſigns, in ſpight of the Authority of the Senate.</p>
               <p>By that laſt Government, War of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity was brought into <hi>Rome:</hi> and becauſe in War, when Laws can ſignify little, force on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly makes the Deciſion, it follows then, that the ſtrongeſt muſt be the Maſter, and by Conſequence that the Empire muſt return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Power of one ſingle Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>And every thing ſo diſpoſed it ſelf for it of
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:56382:286"/> their own accord, that <hi>Polybius,</hi> who lived in the moſt flouriſhing time of the Republick, foreſaw by the diſpoſition only of affairs,<note place="margin">Polyb. <hi>7.</hi> &amp; ſeq. <hi>41.</hi> &amp; ſeq.</note> that the Eſtate of <hi>Rome</hi> would at length return into Monarchy.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of that change was becauſe the Diviſion between the Orders could not be quelled by the <hi>Romans,</hi> but by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of an abſolute Maſter, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand liberty was a thing too much doat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on ever voluntarily to be abandoned. It was neceſſary therefore by little and little to weaken it upon ſpecious Pretexts, and ſo by that means make it capable of being ruined by open force.</p>
               <p>Craft and Deluſion, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, muſt begin by flattering the People, and muſt naturally be followed by Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
               <p>But from thence they muſt fall into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inconvenience by the Power of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, a Miſchief inevitable to that State.</p>
               <p>In fine, that Monarchy which the <hi>Caeſars</hi> formed, being raiſed by Arms, it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary it ſhould be all Military; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was eſtabliſhed under the name of Emperor, a proper Title, and natural for commanding of Armies.</p>
               <p>Hereby you may ſee, that as the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick had its inevitable weak ſide, that is to ſay, Jealouſy between the People and the Senate: So likewiſe had the Monarchy of the <hi>Caeſars</hi> its <hi>Foible;</hi> and that was the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs of the Soldiers, who had made them.</p>
               <pb n="559" facs="tcp:56382:286"/>
               <p>For it was impoſſible that the Soldiers who had changed the Government, and ſet up Emperors, ſhould be long before they perceived that it was effectually they who diſpoſed of the Empire.</p>
               <p>You may now add to the times that you have already obſerved, thoſe which point out to you the State and Change of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia: That when it was ſubjected and fixed to the Senate, and People of <hi>Rome;</hi> that when it was only fixed to the Generals; that when it was raiſed to the abſolute Power under the Military Title of Emperors; that, when being in a manner the Miſtreſs of her own Emperors, which ſhe created, ſhe made them and unmade them as ſhe had a Mind. And from thence happened the outragious Seditions, the Diſorders, and the Wars which you have ſeen; from thence in a word, came the ruin of the Militia, with that of the Empire.</p>
               <p>Such were the remarkable times, which the changes of the State of <hi>Rome</hi> conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in her ſelf, obſerved to us. Thoſe which diſcover it to us in reference to other People, are as eaſily diſcernable.</p>
               <p>There was a time when ſhe fought againſt her Equalls, and when ſhe was in danger. It laſted a little above five Hundred Years, and ended with the ruin of the <hi>Gauls</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and of the Empire of the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That when ſhe fought, was always more ſtrong, and without danger, how great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Wars were that ſhe undertook. It laſted two Hundred Years, and came down as far as the Eſtabliſhment of the Empire of the <hi>Caeſars.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="560" facs="tcp:56382:287"/>
               <p>That when ſhe kept up her Empire and Majeſty. It laſted four Hundred Years, and ended in the Reign of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Great.</p>
               <p>And in a word that when the Empire being wounded on all Parts, fell away by little and little. That Eſtate which laſted alſo three Hundred Years, began in the Children of the <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and ended at laſt in <hi>Charlemain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am not ignorant that your Highneſs might add to the cauſes of the ruin of <hi>Rome,</hi> many particular Accidents. The Severities of the Creditors towards their Debtors, ſtirred up very great and frequent Revolts. The prodigious number of Gladiators and Slaves, wherewith <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-charged, cauſed many horrible Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences, and alſo Bloody Wars. <hi>Rome</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quite ſpent with ſo many Civil, and ſtrange Wars, made ſo many new Citizens, either out of Faction, or in Juſtice, that ſhe could ſcarce know her ſelf amidſt that vaſt number of Strangers, which ſhe had natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized. The Senate was filld with <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Blood was mingled: the love of their Country, by which <hi>Rome</hi> was raiſed above all the People in the World, was not natural to thoſe Citizens that came from abroad, and the reſt were ſpoiled by the Mixture. Patialities were multiplied with that prodigious Multiplicity of new Citizens, and the turbulent Spirits there found out new ways to embroyl and ruin her.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the number of the
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:56382:287"/> Poor increaſed without end, thorough the Luxury, Debauches, and Idleneſs that was encouraged. Thoſe who ſaw themſelves ruined, had no refuge but in Seditions, and in every caſe, they were little concern'd that all ſhould be deſtroyed with them. You know what cauſed <hi>Cataline's</hi> Conſpiracy. The Grandees who are ambitious, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, who had nothing to loſe, always took delight in Change. Thoſe two ſorts of Citizens prevailed in <hi>Rome;</hi> and the Coparcened State, which alone holds all in Ballance in popular Eſtates, being the weakeſt, the Republick muſt of neceſſity fall.</p>
               <p>To that alſo may be added the particular Humour and Genius of thoſe who were the cauſe of thoſe great Commotions: I mean the <hi>Gracchi, Marius, Sylla, Pompey, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caeſar, Anthony,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> I have obſerved ſomething of them, but I applied my ſelf chiefly to dicover to you the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal cauſes and the true root of the Evil, that is to ſay, that Jealouſy between the two Orders, of which it was very requiſite you ſhould conſider all the conſequences.</p>
               <p>But your Highneſs may pleaſe to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that that long Chain of particular Cauſes which make and unmake Empires, depend upon the ſecret Orders and Decrees of the Divine Providence. God that ſitteth in the higheſt Heavens holds the Reins of all the Kingdoms. He hath all Hearts in his Hands; ſometimes, he reſtrains the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſometimes again he lets them looſe at full rage, and by that he ſtirs up all Mankind.
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:56382:288"/> Is he pleaſed to make Conquerors? He cauſes a Dread to march before them, and at the ſame time inſpires them and their Souldiers with an invincible Boldneſs. Is he pleaſed to make Legiſlators? He ſends them his Spirit of Wiſdom and Foreſight, he cauſes them to prevent the Evils which threaten the States, and to lay the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of publick Tranquillity. He knows that humane Wiſdom is always ſhort in ſome place; he enlightens it, he opens the Eyes of the Underſtanding, and afterwards he aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons them to their own Ignorances, he blinds the Judgment, he precipitates it, and confounds it with it ſelf: Humane Wiſdom is perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and embaraſſed in its own Subtilties; and its own Precautions are as ſo many Snares to it. God by this means exerciſes his fearful Judgments, according to the Rules of his Juſtice which are always infallible. 'Tis he that prepares Effects in the moſt diſtant Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and who ſtrikes thoſe fatal Blows of which the counter-blows reaches ſo far. When he is pleaſed to let go the latter, and to overturn Empires, every thing is weak and irregular in their Councils. <hi>Egypt,</hi> formerly ſo wiſe, goes ſtaggering, reeling, and as it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted, becauſe the Lord hath ſhed the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Dizzineſs and Confuſion in all her Councils: She no longer knows what ſhe does, ſhe is loſt to her ſelf. But that Men may not herein be deceived, God repaireth when he ſeeth good, the ſtragling Senſes, and he that inſulted over the Blindneſs of others, falls himſelf into more <hi>Egyptian</hi> Darkneſs, and often times without any thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:56382:288"/> elſe to confound his Sence and Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, than his too long Proſperities.</p>
               <p>Thus it is that God Reigneth over all People. Let us no longer talk of Chance or Fortune, or ſpeak of it only as a Name wherewith we conceal our Ignorance. That which is Chance in reſpect of our uncertain Councils, is a concerted Deſign in a higher Council, that is to ſay, in that eternal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, which circumſcribes all Cauſes and all Effects in one and the ſame Order. Thus all concurs to the ſame end, and it is for want of underſtanding the all that we find of Chance or of Irregularity in particular Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents and Emergencies.</p>
               <p>By that is verified the Saying of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.15.</note> that <hi>God is the bleſſed and only Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi> Bleſſed, whoſe Repoſe is unalterable, who ſeeth every thing to change without changing himſelf, and who makes all Changes by an Immutable Council; who gives and who takes away Power, who transfers it from one Man to another, from one Houſe to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from one People to another, to ſhew that they have it only by way of Loan, and that it is he alone in whom it naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.</p>
               <p>Wherefore all Governors find themſelves the Subjects of a greater Power. They a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t more or leſs than they think for, and their Councils have ever more had unforeſeen Effects.</p>
               <p>They neither are Maſters of the Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which Ages paſt have made in their Affairs, nor can they foreſee what Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rſe
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:56382:289"/> the times to come will take, ſo far are they from being able to force it. He alone holds all things in his Hands, who knows the Name of that which is, and that which is not yet, who preſides at all times, and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipates all Councils.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> little thought he laboured for his Captains, nor that he ruined his Houſe when he gained his Conqueſt. When <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> animated the <hi>Romans</hi> with ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Love of Liberty, he as little thought he was caſting into their Minds the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of that unbridled and maſterleſs Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, by which the Tyranny he deſigned to deſtroy, was one day to be re-eſtabliſhed with greater Severity than under the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quins.</hi> When the <hi>Caeſars</hi> flattered the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, they had no deſigns of giving Maſters to their Succeſſors and to the Empire. In a word, there is no humane Power but what, do what it can, ſerves for other Deſigns than it aims at at preſent. God alone knows how to bring about all things according to his own Will. Wherefore every thing is ſurpriſing if we only look to particular Cauſes, and yet nevertheleſs every thing goes on in an orderly manner. This Diſcourſe makes you ſee it clearly, and not to ſpeak of other Empires, you ſee by how many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſeen Councils, but yet always connected in themſelves, the Fortune of <hi>Rome</hi> hath been carried on from <hi>Romulus</hi> down to <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your Highneſs might perhaps have thought I ſhould have told you ſomewhat more of your own Country, and of <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi>
                  <pb n="565" facs="tcp:56382:289"/> who was the Founder of the new Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. But beſides that his Hiſtory makes a part of that of <hi>France,</hi> which you your ſelf have wrote, and which you have already ſo far proceeded in, I reſerve to make you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Diſcourſe of that, wherein I ſhall be neceſſarily obliged to ſpeak to you of <hi>France,</hi> and of that great Conqueror, who being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual in Valour to thoſe which Antiquity hath the moſt boaſted of, doth yet exceed them in Piety, in Wiſdom, and Juſtice.</p>
               <p>That ſome Diſcourſe ſhall diſcover to you the Cauſes of the prodigious Succeſſes of <hi>Mahomet</hi> and this Succeſſors. That Empire which began two hundred Years before <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemain,</hi> may find its place in that Diſcourſe; but I though it would be much better to ſhew you in one continued Series its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and its declenſion.</p>
               <p>So that I have no more to tell you in this firſt Part of my Univerſal Hiſtory. You will diſcover all the Secrets of it, and you will have nothing to do but to obſerve in it all the Progreſs of Religion, and that of the great Empires down to <hi>Charlemain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whileſt you will ſee almoſt all fall of themſelves, and Religion only ſupport it ſelf by its own Strength, you will eaſily then diſcern what is ſolid Grandeur, and where a wiſe and conſiderate Man is to place all his Hopes.</p>
